## What Is the Job Detail View?

When you click on any job card or select **View Job Details** from the dropdown, you open the full detail page for that job. This is where you access the complete job description, run AI-powered tools, manage your network for the role, and track everything in one place.

## Viewing and Editing Job Details

### Job Header

The header displays:

### Editing the Job Description

If the job description was pasted incorrectly or you want to add supplementary information, you can edit it directly from the Description tab.

Changing the status here immediately updates the card position on your My Jobs board.

## Managing Your Network for This Job

The **Network** tab shows all connections associated with this job — employees, hiring managers, and recruiters you have contacted.

### Adding Networks from Job Detail

Click **Add Network** to open a dropdown with two options:

- **Connect to Employees** — Searches LinkedIn for people working in similar roles at the company
- **Connect to Hiring Managers** — Searches LinkedIn for recruiters and hiring managers at the company

Both options open the Find Network dialog. See [Find Network](/job-board/find-network) for the full workflow.

Network cards show each connection's name, title, profile photo, and current outreach status.

## Action Bar

A sticky action bar at the bottom of the page provides quick access to the most common actions:

| Button | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Apply Now** | Opens the original job posting in a new tab |
| **Network** | Shows your network count and scrolls to the Network section |
| **Save** | Toggles the job's saved/bookmarked status |
| **Share** | Shares the job using your device's native share functionality |

## Adding Notes

The **Notes** tab is your private scratchpad for each job. Use it to track:

- Why you are interested in this role
- Key contacts or referral sources
- Interview preparation notes
- Compensation details discussed
- Follow-up reminders

Notes are visible only to you and persist across sessions.

<Tip>
Use notes to track details that do not fit neatly into other categories — salary expectations, recruiter names, interview dates, or things you want to mention in your next conversation. This context becomes invaluable when you are managing 10+ active applications simultaneously.
