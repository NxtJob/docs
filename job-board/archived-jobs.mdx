## What Are Archived Jobs?

Archived Jobs is where jobs go when you remove them from your active My Jobs board without deleting them permanently. Archiving keeps your active pipeline focused on roles you are currently pursuing while preserving a record of everything you have explored.

Common reasons to archive a job:

- The role was filled before you applied
- You decided the role was not a good fit after further research
- You want to revisit the opportunity later
- You are cleaning up your board to focus on active applications

## What Information Is Shown

Each archived job card displays:

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| **Company Logo** | The company's logo (or a placeholder icon if unavailable) |
| **Match Score** | Your ATS keyword match percentage, color-coded: green (75%+), yellow (50-74%), red (below 50%) |
| **Job Title** | The role title |
| **Company Name** | The company name |
| **Time Since Update** | How long ago the job was last updated or archived |
| **Restore Button** | Brings the job back to your active pipeline |

The page header shows the total count of archived jobs (e.g., "X jobs archived").

## Restoring Jobs

To bring an archived job back to your active My Jobs board:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the job">
    Browse or search the Archived Jobs page to locate the job you want to restore.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Restore">
    Click the **Restore** button on the job card. A confirmation prompt appears.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm restoration">
    Confirm to move the job back to your active pipeline. It returns to its previous status column on the My Jobs board.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## When the Archive Is Empty

If you have not archived any jobs, the page displays:

- **"No Archived Jobs"** — Jobs you archive from your board will appear here. You can restore them anytime.

<Tip>
Archive rather than delete. Deleting a job removes it permanently along with all associated notes, network connections, and match scores. Archiving preserves everything so you can restore the full context if the opportunity reopens or a similar role appears at the same company.
