## What Is the Recruitment Agencies Tab?

Recruitment Agencies is a board for tracking staffing firms, headhunters, and recruiting agencies that may have relevant opportunities. Many senior-level roles are filled through agency channels rather than public job boards, making this an important part of a comprehensive job search.

Each agency is displayed as a card with actions for networking, job exploration, and AI-powered research.

## Adding a Recruitment Agency

### Adding Manually

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Agency">
    Click the **"Add Agency"** button at the top of the Recruitment Agencies page. A dialog opens with a form.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in agency details">
    Complete the form:
    - **Agency Name** (required) — The agency's official name
    - **Location** (optional) — Where the agency is based
    - **Company Website** (optional) — The agency's website URL
    - **Industry** (optional) — Industries the agency specializes in
    - **Employee Count** (optional) — Size of the agency
    - **Company Description** (optional) — Notes about the agency or your relationship with them
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Add Agency** to create the card.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Adding via Chrome Extension

When browsing an agency's LinkedIn page or website, use the NxtJob Chrome Extension to save it directly to your Recruitment Agencies list.

## Agency Card Actions

Each agency card provides the same set of quick actions:

| Action | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Jobs** | Shows jobs sourced through or associated with this agency |
| **Networks** | Shows your connections at this agency |
| **Ask Nova** | Opens the AI assistant with this agency's context (Nova only) |
| **Find Network** | Searches LinkedIn for contacts at this agency (Nova only) |
| **Edit** | Updates agency information |
| **Delete** | Removes the agency from your list (with confirmation) |

## Networking with Recruitment Agencies

Click **Find Network** on any agency card to search for recruiters and contacts. People you connect with through an agency are tagged as "Recruitment Agency" connections on your [My Networks](/job-board/my-networks) board.

When networking with agency contacts, the message templates adjust to use a "Cold Outreach (Employee)" template rather than the referral-focused templates used for direct company connections.

## Searching Agencies

Use the search bar at the top of the page to filter agencies by name.

<Tip>
Focus on agencies that specialize in your industry and seniority level. A boutique agency that places VP-level engineering leaders will deliver far better results than a generalist firm. Add 3-5 specialized agencies to start, and use Ask Nova to research which agencies are most active in your target market.
