## Why Senior Professionals Need a Smarter Job Board

If you have been in the industry for 5, 10, or 20+ years, a spreadsheet or browser bookmarks folder is not going to cut it. You are applying to multiple roles, networking with hiring managers, tracking interview stages, and tailoring resumes per application — all simultaneously. Without a system, things slip through the cracks.

The NxtJob Job Board at [jobs.nxtjob.ai](https://jobs.nxtjob.ai) is a kanban-style job pipeline that manages every stage of your job search from first discovery to final offer. It integrates directly with the Resume Builder, Chrome Extension, and LinkedIn automation to create a single command center for your entire job change journey.

## How the Job Board Fits the 90-Day Journey

The NxtJob platform is designed around a 90-day timeline to land a salary hike:

| Phase | Tool | What You Do |
|---|---|---|
| **Week 1-2** | Resume Builder | Build and optimize your primary resume |
| **Week 2-4** | Job Board + Chrome Extension | Discover jobs, save them, tailor resumes per role |
| **Week 3-8** | Job Board + Networking | Apply, track progress, network with employees and recruiters |
| **Week 4-12** | Job Board + Interview Prep | Move through screening, interviewing, and negotiate offers |

The Job Board is where you spend the majority of your 90 days. It is the operational hub that connects every other tool.

## What Is Included

The Job Board has six main sections, accessible from the top navigation tabs:

| Section | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Recommendations** | AI-curated job listings matched to your niche and preferences (Nova only) |
| **My Jobs** | Kanban board tracking every job through Saved, Applied, Screening, Interviewing, Offer, and Rejected |
| **Target Companies** | A list of companies you want to work at, with direct networking actions |
| **Recruitment Agencies** | Track recruitment firms and agency contacts |
| **My Networks** | Manage networking connections with employees and recruiters across all your saved jobs |
| **Archived** | Jobs you have moved out of your active pipeline |

## Nova vs Standard Subscription

Some Job Board features require an active Nova subscription. Here is what each tier includes:

| Feature | Standard | Nova |
|---|---|---|
| My Jobs board (kanban pipeline) | Yes | Yes |
| Add jobs manually | Yes | Yes |
| Target Companies | Yes | Yes |
| Recruitment Agencies | Yes | Yes |
| Archived Jobs | Yes | Yes |
| Job Recommendations | No | Yes |
| Ask Nova (AI job actions) | No | Yes |
| LinkedIn Automation | No | Yes |
| Nova Chat | No | Yes |
| Find Network (AI-powered) | No | Yes |

<Tip>
Nova features are marked throughout this documentation with a "Nova Only" callout. If you are on the Standard plan, you can still manage your full job pipeline manually. Nova automates discovery, networking outreach, and follow-ups to save you hours each week.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in">
    Navigate to [jobs.nxtjob.ai](https://jobs.nxtjob.ai) and sign in with your NxtJob.ai account (Google SSO, LinkedIn, or email).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your niche">
    When you first sign in, you will be prompted to set up your job search niche — your target industry, role category, and job title aliases. This powers the recommendation engine and filters.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore the board">
    You land on the **My Jobs** page, which displays an empty kanban board with status columns. Start by saving jobs from Recommendations (Nova) or adding them manually.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Chrome Extension">
    Install the NxtJob Chrome Extension from the Chrome Web Store to save jobs directly from LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, and other job boards with one click.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Navigation Structure

The Job Board uses a tab-based navigation at the top of the page:

- **Recommendations** — AI-curated job listings (Nova only)
- **My Jobs** — Your active job pipeline
- **Target Companies** — Companies you are targeting
- **Recruitment** — Recruitment agencies you are working with
- **My Networks** — All your networking connections
- **Archived** — Jobs removed from the active pipeline

The left sidebar provides access to the broader NxtJob ecosystem: Resume Builder, Cover Letters, Interview Prep, Community, and more.

<Tip>
Bookmark [jobs.nxtjob.ai](https://jobs.nxtjob.ai) and make it a daily habit to check your board. Senior professionals who log in daily during their job search close offers significantly faster than those who check sporadically.
