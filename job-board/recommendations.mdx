<Tip>
Job Recommendations is a **Nova-exclusive** feature. You need an active Nova subscription to access this page. Standard users can add jobs manually from the My Jobs tab.
</Tip>

## What Are Job Recommendations?

The Recommendations page surfaces job listings that match your professional niche — your target industry, role category, and preferred job titles. Instead of searching across dozens of job boards manually, the recommendation engine aggregates and filters listings so you see only what is relevant.

Each recommendation card shows the job title, company, location, posting date, and source portal. From any card, you can save the job to your pipeline, view the full description, or take AI-powered actions through Ask Nova.

## Customizing Recommendations with Filters

Filters sit at the top of the Recommendations page and let you narrow results to exactly what you are looking for.

| Filter | What It Controls |
|---|---|
| **Industry** | The sector or domain (e.g., Technology, Finance, Healthcare) |
| **Role Category** | The functional area (e.g., Engineering, Product, Marketing) |
| **Job Title Alias** | Specific title variations you are targeting (e.g., "VP Engineering," "Director of Engineering") |
| **Job Portals** | Which job boards to pull from (LinkedIn, Naukri, Career Page) |
| **Keywords to Include** | Specific terms that must appear in the listing |

  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your criteria">
    Choose values for any combination of Industry, Role Category, Job Title Alias, Job Portals, and Keywords. You do not need to fill every filter — use only what is relevant.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply filters">
    The recommendations list updates to show only jobs matching your selected criteria.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clear filters">
    Remove individual filter values or clear all filters to return to the full recommendation set.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Tips for Better Recommendations

- Add multiple Job Title Aliases to catch variations. A "Senior Engineering Manager" role might also be listed as "Engineering Lead" or "Head of Engineering."
- Use Keywords to Include for must-have technologies or methodologies (e.g., "Kubernetes," "Series B," "remote").
- If recommendations feel too broad, narrow the Industry and Role Category first, then fine-tune with keywords.

## Switching Between Niches

If you have set up multiple job search niches (for example, targeting both "Engineering Management" and "Product Management" roles), you can switch between them using the niche selector dropdown.

Each niche maintains its own set of filters, recommendations, and saved jobs. Switching niches changes the entire context of your Recommendations page.

## Saving Jobs from Recommendations

When you find a job that interests you:

1. Click on the job card to view the full description.
2. Click **Save** to add it to your My Jobs pipeline. The job is placed in the **Saved** column.
3. From there, you can move it through your pipeline stages as you apply, interview, and progress.

Saved jobs appear on your My Jobs board and are available for ATS scoring in the Resume Builder.

## Ask Nova — AI-Powered Job Actions

Ask Nova is an AI assistant that can perform several actions on any recommended job. When you open a job listing, you can ask Nova to:

| Action | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Calculate ATS Score** | Analyzes how well your resume matches the job description and returns a keyword match percentage |
| **Customize Resume** | Generates a tailored version of your resume optimized for this specific job |
| **Generate Cover Letter** | Creates a cover letter targeted to the job description and company |
| **Find Connections** | Searches for employees and recruiters at the company you can network with |
| **Interview Questions** | Generates likely interview questions based on the job description |

<Tip>
Use "Calculate ATS Score" before applying to any job. If your score is below 75%, use "Customize Resume" to generate an optimized version. This two-step workflow takes minutes and dramatically increases your pass rate through ATS filters.
</Tip>

## Viewing Job Descriptions

Click on any job card to expand the full job description. The description view shows:

- Full job posting text
- Company information
- Location and work arrangement (remote, hybrid, onsite)
- Posting date and source portal
- Direct link to the original posting

You can read the description, save the job, or use Ask Nova actions all from this view.

## When Recommendations Are Not Relevant

If you are not getting relevant job recommendations:

1. **Review your niche setup** — Make sure your Industry, Role Category, and Job Title Aliases accurately reflect what you are looking for.
2. **Add more Job Title Aliases** — Different companies use different titles for the same role.
3. **Broaden your Keywords** — Overly specific keyword filters can exclude valid matches.
4. **Check your Job Portals** — Ensure you have selected portals that are active in your geography and industry.
5. **Update your niche** — If you have pivoted your job search direction, update your niche settings to match.
