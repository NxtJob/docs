## What Is Nova Chat?

Nova Chat is an AI copilot embedded throughout the Job Board. It appears as a sidebar panel that understands the context of whatever you are looking at — a specific job, a target company, or a recruitment agency — and can take action on your behalf.

Nova can generate cover letters, find networking connections, optimize your resume, prepare you for interviews, and answer questions about jobs and companies.

|---|---|
| **Generate Custom Cover Letter** | Creates a cover letter tailored to the job description and your resume |
| **Show Potential Connections** | Finds employees and hiring managers at the company on LinkedIn |
| **Resume Tips** | Provides specific optimization suggestions for your resume based on the job |
| **Tell Me Why I'm a Right Fit** | Analyzes your resume against the job and explains your strengths |

| **Find HR Connections** | Searches LinkedIn for hiring managers and recruiters |
| **Job Search** | Searches for additional job recommendations |

### Company-Specific Actions

When chatting in the context of a target company or recruitment agency, Nova can:

- **Find Employee Connections** — Search LinkedIn for people at the company
- **Find HR Connections** — Search LinkedIn for hiring contacts

## Using Nova Chat

### Asking Questions

Type your question in the input field ("Ask me anything...") and press Enter or click the send button. Nova responds in real time with streaming text.

You can ask free-form questions like:

- "What skills does this job require that I'm missing?"
- "Draft a networking message for the hiring manager"
- "What should I know about this company before interviewing?"

### Quick Action Suggestions

Nova surfaces suggested actions based on context. Click any suggestion to trigger it immediately rather than typing a full question.

### Chat Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Like / Dislike** | Rate Nova's responses to improve future suggestions |
| **Copy** | Copy any response to your clipboard |
| **Regenerate** | Get a different version of the most recent response |
| **Search** | Search through your conversation history |
| **Streaming** | Responses appear in real time as Nova generates them |

### Connection Invites in Chat

When Nova finds networking connections, the results include profile cards with:

- Profile photo and name
- Current title
- A **Connect** button to send a LinkedIn connection request directly from the chat

This means you can find, evaluate, and connect with people without leaving the conversation.

## Tips for Getting the Most from Nova

- **Be specific** — "Help me with my resume" is less effective than "Which keywords from this job description am I missing in my resume?"
- **Use it contextually** — Chat from a specific job page rather than in a general context. Nova's responses are significantly better when it understands the exact job or company.
- **Chain actions** — Run ATS Check first, then ask Nova to Customize Resume based on the results. Follow up with a Cover Letter. This sequential workflow produces the best output.
- **Review and edit** — Nova generates strong first drafts, but always review and personalize before sending messages or submitting applications.

<Tip>
Nova Chat is most powerful when used as part of a workflow. For any job you are serious about: (1) run ATS Check, (2) customize your resume, (3) generate a cover letter, (4) find connections, and (5) practice interview questions. This five-step routine takes about 15 minutes per job and dramatically improves your odds.
