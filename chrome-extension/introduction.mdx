## What Is the NxtJob Chrome Extension?

The NxtJob Chrome Extension is a browser-based companion that works alongside LinkedIn and 15+ job portals. It bridges the gap between where you find jobs and where you manage your job search. Instead of copying and pasting job details manually, the extension extracts job listings with one click, optimizes your LinkedIn profile, calculates ATS match scores, and powers AI-driven networking — all from a sidebar that appears on supported sites.

The extension is listed on the Chrome Web Store as **"NxtJob AI LinkedIn Optimization & Job Tracker"** with a 4.6-star rating, 4,000+ users, and a Featured badge.

<Tip>
  The Chrome Extension is most powerful when paired with the Resume Builder and Job Board. Jobs you save from portals appear instantly on your My Jobs board. ATS scores calculated in the extension use the same engine as the Resume Builder. Start with the introduction pages for the [Resume Builder](/resume-builder/introduction) and [Job Board](/job-board/introduction) if you have not set those up yet.
