<Tip>
  Nova Reply is a Premium feature. It requires an active Premium subscription and works only within LinkedIn's messaging interface.
</Tip>

Nova Reply is an AI messaging assistant that integrates directly into LinkedIn's messaging interface. When you open a conversation on LinkedIn, the extension injects a **Nova Reply** button into the message composer bar — right next to the Send button. Instead of spending minutes crafting each networking message from scratch, you click the button, choose a mode, and get a professional, context-aware draft in seconds.

## Where Nova Reply Appears

When you open any LinkedIn conversation, a blue **Nova Reply** button appears in the message composer toolbar, positioned between the emoji/attachment icons and the Send button. Clicking the upward arrow on the button opens a dropdown with two options:

- **Write Your Own** — You provide a directive and the AI generates a message based on your instructions
- **Quick Reply** — Select from saved message templates or create new ones

## Write Your Own Mode

Write Your Own mode lets you describe what you want to say in plain language, and Nova Reply generates a polished, professional message based on the conversation context and your directive.

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Nova Reply and select Write Your Own">
    Click the **Nova Reply** button in the LinkedIn message composer, then select **Write Your Own** from the dropdown. The NOVA Reply panel opens as an overlay.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your directive">
    The panel shows two tabs at the top: **Write Your Own** (selected, highlighted in blue) and **Quick Reply**. Below the tabs, you see the prompt: "Provide a directive for the AI regarding the specific response you need." Type your instruction in the text field — for example, "keep it polite" or "thank them for the referral and ask for a 5-minute call."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for the AI to generate a response">
    After entering your directive, the panel shows a loading state with "Generating AI Response..." and the message "Please wait while we analyze the conversation and create a personalized reply." The AI reads the full conversation thread and combines it with your directive to craft the message.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the generated message">
    The generated message appears in the panel under an **AI Response** label. The AI produces a complete, ready-to-send message that incorporates conversation context, your background, and your directive. Two buttons appear at the bottom:
    - **Insert** — Places the generated message into the LinkedIn compose field
    - **Re-Generate** — Generates a new version if you are not satisfied with the first draft
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insert and send">
    Click **Insert** to place the message into the LinkedIn compose field. Review the text, make any final edits, and click **Send**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Generated Response Example

The AI generates messages that are specific to the conversation. For example, with the directive "keep it polite" in a conversation about a referral, Nova Reply produced a message that thanked the person by name, referenced specific technical achievements (refactoring components, implementing CI/CD pipelines), and ended with a clear call to action asking for a 5-minute chat.

### After Inserting

Once you click **Insert**, the generated message appears in the LinkedIn compose field. You can edit it directly before sending. LinkedIn's quick suggestion pills (e.g., "Please", "Thanks", "May I have your phone number?") remain available above the compose area.

## Quick Reply Mode

Quick Reply mode provides instant access to saved message templates. Instead of writing a directive each time, you select from a library of pre-built messages that you can insert with one click.

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Nova Reply and select Quick Reply">
    Click the **Nova Reply** button and select **Quick Reply** from the dropdown. The NOVA Reply panel opens with the **Quick Reply** tab active (highlighted in blue).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Browse saved templates">
    The panel shows "Select any one of the messages:" followed by your saved templates. Each template displays its name and a preview of the message content. For example, a "Resume Link" template might contain your resume URL from resume.nxtjob.ai.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select and copy">
    Click on a template to select it. Use the **Copy** button in the bottom-right corner to copy the message content to your clipboard, then paste it into the LinkedIn compose field.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Creating a New Template

Click the **+ Create** button in the top-right corner of the Quick Reply panel to create a new template. A **"Create quick reply"** dialog appears with two fields:

- **Enter quick reply name** — A short name to identify the template (e.g., "Resume Link", "Referral Ask", "Thank You Note")
- **Enter quick reply message** — The full message text you want to reuse

Click **Create** to save the template, or **Discard** to cancel. Saved templates appear in your Quick Reply list and are available across all LinkedIn conversations.

</Frame>

<Tip>
  Create templates for messages you send repeatedly: your resume link, a standard referral request, a post-interview thank you, or a brief self-introduction. This turns a 5-minute writing task into a 5-second click.
</Tip>

## The NOVA Reply Panel

The NOVA Reply panel is a floating overlay that appears on top of your LinkedIn messaging interface. It includes:

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| **NOVA Reply header** | Panel title with a close (X) button |
| **Write Your Own tab** | AI-powered message generation from your directive |
| **Quick Reply tab** | Saved template library |
| **Directive field** (Write Your Own) | Text input where you describe what you want the AI to write |
| **AI Response area** (Write Your Own) | Displays the generated message with Insert and Re-Generate actions |
| **Template list** (Quick Reply) | Your saved message templates with Copy functionality |
| **+ Create button** (Quick Reply) | Opens the create template dialog |

## When to Use Each Mode

| Scenario | Mode | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Responding to a referral offer | Write Your Own | The AI reads the thread and crafts a personalized thank-you with your background details |
| Following up after an interview | Write Your Own | Describe your intent and get a polished follow-up that references the conversation |
| Sharing your resume link | Quick Reply | Save your resume URL as a template and insert it instantly |
| Sending a standard introduction | Quick Reply | Create a reusable self-introduction template |
| Replying to a recruiter's question | Write Your Own | Let the AI draft a response based on the conversation context and your directive |
| Sending a cold outreach pitch | Write Your Own | Describe the person's role and your goal — the AI handles the tone and structure |

## Tips for Effective Use

<Tip>
  Nova Reply generates drafts, not final messages. Always review and personalize the generated text before clicking Send. Adding a specific detail — a reference to the person's recent post, a mutual connection, or a shared experience — transforms a good AI draft into a message that feels genuinely personal.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Build your Quick Reply template library early. Start with 3-4 templates: your resume link, a referral request, a thank-you note, and a brief introduction. As your job search progresses, add templates for specific scenarios you encounter repeatedly.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  For senior professionals managing 20 or more networking conversations simultaneously, Nova Reply can save hours per week. Write Your Own mode handles the complex, context-specific messages while Quick Reply handles the repetitive ones. Together, they let you maintain high-quality communication at scale.
