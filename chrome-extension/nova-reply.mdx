<Tip>
  Nova Reply is a Premium feature. It requires an active Premium subscription and works only within LinkedIn's messaging interface.
</Tip>

Nova Reply is an AI messaging assistant that integrates directly into LinkedIn's messaging interface. When you open a conversation on LinkedIn, the extension adds an AI button to the message composer. Nova Reply reads the conversation context and generates relevant, professional replies — saving you time when managing multiple networking conversations simultaneously.

## Where It Appears

Nova Reply activates inside LinkedIn's messaging interface. When you open any conversation, an AI-powered button appears near the message input field. Clicking it opens the Nova Reply panel, where you choose between Quick Reply mode and Write mode.

## Quick Reply Mode

Quick Reply mode is designed for speed. When you activate it, Nova Reply:

1. Reads the entire conversation thread for context
2. Analyzes the other person's most recent message
3. Generates a contextual, professional reply
4. Presents the draft for you to review, edit, and send

This mode is ideal for responding to connection acceptances, follow-up messages, and interview scheduling conversations where maintaining momentum matters.

## Write Mode

Write mode gives you control over the direction of the message. Instead of generating a reply based on the conversation, Nova Reply generates a message based on your instructions.

<Tip>
  Nova Reply generates drafts, not final messages. Always review and personalize the generated text before sending. Adding a specific detail — a reference to the person's recent post, a mutual connection, or a shared experience — transforms a good AI draft into a message that feels genuinely personal.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  For senior professionals managing 20 or more networking conversations simultaneously, Nova Reply can save hours per week. Quick Reply mode is particularly valuable for maintaining momentum in conversations without spending time crafting each response from scratch.
