### From NxtJob Product Pages

Every page on [resume.nxtjob.ai](https://resume.nxtjob.ai) and [jobs.nxtjob.ai](https://jobs.nxtjob.ai) includes a "Download Extension" prompt. Clicking it takes you directly to the Chrome Web Store listing, where you can complete installation as described above.

## Pin the Extension to Your Toolbar

After installation, the NxtJob icon may be hidden behind Chrome's Extensions menu. Pinning it makes it accessible with one click on any page.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the puzzle-piece (Extensions) icon in the Chrome toolbar">
    This opens a dropdown listing all your installed extensions.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Find "NxtJob AI LinkedIn Optimization & Job Tracker" in the list'>
    It appears alongside your other installed extensions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the pin icon next to it">
    The NxtJob icon now appears permanently in your toolbar, visible on every page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Sign In

The extension requires you to be signed in to sync saved jobs, resumes, and ATS scores with your NxtJob account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the NxtJob icon in your toolbar on any page">
    The extension popup opens.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Click "Sign In"'>
    You are prompted to authenticate with your NxtJob account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign in with your NxtJob account">
    Use the same account you use on resume.nxtjob.ai — Google SSO, LinkedIn, or email are all supported.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start using the extension on supported sites">
    Once signed in, the extension activates automatically when you visit a supported job portal or LinkedIn page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  You must sign in with the same account you use on resume.nxtjob.ai and jobs.nxtjob.ai. Jobs saved via the extension appear on your Job Board, and ATS scores use your Resume Builder resumes.
</Tip>

## How the Extension Behaves on Different Sites

The extension adapts its interface depending on which site you are visiting. You do not need to configure this — the correct panel opens automatically.

| Site | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **Supported job portal** (LinkedIn jobs, Naukri, Indeed, etc.) | A sidebar opens with the Job Tracker form, pre-filled with extracted job details |
| **LinkedIn profile (your own)** | A sidebar opens with the Profile Optimization panel and Export to Resume option |
| **LinkedIn profile (someone else's)** | A sidebar opens with the AI Connect panel, showing the person's details and networking actions |
| **LinkedIn messaging** | Nova Reply button appears in the message composer (Premium) |
| **LinkedIn company page** | Option to add the company to Target Companies or Recruitment Agencies |
| **Unsupported site** | Clicking the toolbar icon opens a popup with manual job entry fields and quick links |

<Tip>
  If the sidebar does not open automatically on a supported job portal, click the NxtJob icon in your toolbar. Some portals require a page refresh after installation for the content script to activate.
