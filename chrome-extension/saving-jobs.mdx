When you visit a job listing on a supported portal, the NxtJob extension sidebar opens automatically on the right side of the page. It extracts the job title, company name, and job description from the page and pre-fills the form — no copy-pasting required.

## How Job Saving Works

The sidebar shows a **Job Tracker** panel with the following elements:

- **Job Tracker** heading with a **View Saved Jobs** link at the top right
- **ATS match score** shown as a percentage (e.g., "33.33%") with a **Change** link to switch resumes
- The resume name being used for scoring (e.g., "Srivasgarni's Resume")
- **Job Title** field — pre-filled from the page
- **Company Name** field — pre-filled from the page
- **"Posted by a recruitment agency"** checkbox
- **Select Niche** dropdown
- **Job Description** section with extracted content
- **"Add to Job Tracker"** button and a **Clear** button at the bottom

## Saving a Job

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to a job listing">
    Go to a job listing on any supported portal — LinkedIn, Naukri, Indeed, and others. The extension sidebar opens automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the pre-filled details">
    The sidebar extracts and pre-fills the **Job Title** and **Company Name** from the page. Edit either field if the extraction is incorrect.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check the recruitment agency checkbox">
    If the job was posted by a staffing or recruitment firm rather than the employer directly, check **"Posted by a recruitment agency"**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your Niche">
    If you have multiple niches configured (e.g., "Engineering Management" and "Product Management"), select the appropriate one from the **Select Niche** dropdown.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the Job Description">
    The extension extracts the full job description from the page. Scroll through it to confirm it looks complete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add to Job Tracker">
    Click the **"Add to Job Tracker"** button to save the job. It appears instantly on your [My Jobs](/job-board/my-jobs) board in the Saved column.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Job Saved Successfully

After saving, the sidebar transitions to a success screen with:

- A green checkmark and **"Job Saved Successfully"** message
- Text: "View saved jobs in Job Board and generate Resume, Cover Letter and Mock Interview"
- Four action buttons to continue working on the application:
  - **Start Networking** — Opens networking tools for this job
  - **View Job** — Opens the job detail on your Job Board
  - **Customize Resume** — Opens the Resume Builder with this job's context loaded
  - **[Generate Cover Letter](/cover-letter/creating-cover-letters)** — Creates an AI-generated cover letter for this job
- A **"Back to Add Job"** link at the top to save another job from the same page

<Tip>
  After saving a job, use the action buttons on the success screen to immediately start networking or customize your resume. The most effective job seekers tailor their resume for every application — the Customize Resume button takes you directly to the Resume Builder with the job context loaded.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Jobs saved via the extension appear instantly on your [My Jobs](/job-board/my-jobs) board in the Saved column. You can manage them from there — change status, attach resumes, calculate match scores, and more.

## Saving Jobs from Unsupported Sites

On company career pages or other unsupported sites, the extension cannot auto-extract job details. In this case:

1. Click the NxtJob icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension popup.
2. Manually enter the **Job Title** and **Company Name**.
3. Paste the **Job Description** into the description field.
4. Click **"Add to Job Tracker"**.

This ensures you can save any job from any website, even when automatic extraction is not available.

## Duplicate Detection

If you try to save a job that is already in your pipeline, the extension detects the duplicate and notifies you. This prevents duplicate entries from appearing on your My Jobs board.

## Niche Selection

If you have configured multiple job search niches, use the **Select Niche** dropdown in the sidebar to categorize each job under the correct niche. This keeps your Job Board organized when you are actively pursuing roles across different function areas — for example, running separate searches for "Engineering Management" and "Product Management" simultaneously.
