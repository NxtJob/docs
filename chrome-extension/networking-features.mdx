The NxtJob Chrome Extension brings your networking workflow directly into LinkedIn. Rather than switching between tabs to log contacts and companies, you can capture connections, target companies, and recruitment agencies while you browse — with the extension sidebar handling the details.

## AI Connect: Adding LinkedIn Connections

AI Connect lets you add LinkedIn connections directly to your NxtJob networking pipeline. When you visit someone's LinkedIn profile, the extension provides tools to track the connection, categorize their role, and link them to a specific job or company.

### Where AI Connect Appears

AI Connect is available in two places on LinkedIn:

1. **On a LinkedIn profile page** — An "AI Connect" button appears next to the "More" button in the profile action bar (a blue button with a sparkle icon). The extension sidebar also opens alongside the profile, showing the person's details, activity, about section, industry info, and an "AI Connect" button at the top.
2. **From LinkedIn search results** — Available via the extension sidebar when browsing profiles in search.

</Frame>

### The Extension Sidebar on LinkedIn Profiles

When you visit someone else's LinkedIn profile, the extension sidebar displays the following information:

- The person's **name, title, and headline** at the top
- An **"AI Connect"** button
- **Activity** section showing their last activity date
- **About** section with the person's or company's description
- **Employees** count
- **Industry** info
- **Founded in** date (for company profiles)

### Track Connection Modal

Clicking "AI Connect" opens the Track Connection modal. Complete the following fields before submitting:

| Field | Options |
|---|---|
| **Why are you connecting?** | For an Open Job / For a Target Company / For a Recruitment Agency |
| **What role do they play?** | Part of the Hiring Team / A Potential Referral / In the Top Management |
| **Link a Job/Company** | Search and select a specific job or company from your pipeline |
| **Additional Information** | "This person reached out to me" / "This person is the hiring manager" / "Not Included" |
| **Invitation Message** | Text area for your connection request message. Shows "Message will be generated automatically..." as a placeholder when left empty. |

At the bottom of the modal, the **"Track Connection Request"** button submits the form. A **"Message top connections"** link is also available for bulk outreach.

### Adding a Connection via AI Connect

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit the person's LinkedIn profile">
    Navigate to the LinkedIn profile of the person you want to connect with.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click AI Connect">
    Click the **"AI Connect"** button — either on the profile page next to the "More" button, or in the extension sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select why you are connecting">
    In the Track Connection modal, choose one of the three options: **For an Open Job**, **For a Target Company**, or **For a Recruitment Agency**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select what role they play">
    Choose the person's role in your job search: **Part of the Hiring Team**, **A Potential Referral**, or **In the Top Management**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link a job or company">
    Optionally search for and select a specific job or company from your pipeline to associate with this connection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add additional information">
    Use the checkboxes to note relevant context — for example, whether this person reached out to you first or whether they are the hiring manager.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the invitation message">
    Review the auto-generated invitation message or write your own. If you leave the field empty, the platform generates a message based on the connection category and role type you selected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Track Connection Request">
    Submit the form. The connection is added to your [My Networks](/job-board/my-networks) board and the connection request is queued.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Use AI Connect strategically. For each saved job, aim to connect with 2-3 people at the company: one potential referrer in a similar role, one hiring team member, and optionally one senior leader. This multi-touch approach dramatically increases your chances of getting a referral.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  The invitation message field shows "Message will be generated automatically" — the platform crafts personalized messages based on the connection category and role type you selected. You can customize the message before sending, but the AI-generated defaults are designed for high acceptance rates.
</Tip>
