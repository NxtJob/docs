<Tip>
  LinkedIn Profile Optimization is a Premium feature. Connect your LinkedIn account from your NxtJob settings to unlock profile scoring and AI-powered headline and summary generation.
</Tip>

When you visit your own LinkedIn profile with the NxtJob extension installed, the sidebar opens automatically with the **Let's Optimize** panel. It displays your overall profile optimization score as a percentage alongside section-by-section feedback you can act on immediately.

## Connecting Your LinkedIn Account

Before the extension can analyze your profile, you need a Premium subscription and a connected LinkedIn account. Once connected, two buttons appear at the top of the sidebar:

- **Export Profile to Resume** — sends your profile data to the Resume Builder
- **LinkedIn Connected** — confirms your account link is active

If you see a prompt to connect instead of these buttons, go to your NxtJob settings and complete the LinkedIn connection flow.

## Your Overall Score

The sidebar displays a circular progress indicator showing your overall optimization score (for example, 85%). This score is a weighted average across all 14 analyzed sections. Below the score indicator, a row of section icons lets you jump directly into any individual section's detail view.

## Profile Sections Analyzed

The extension evaluates 14 sections of your LinkedIn profile. Each section is checked against specific criteria:

| Section | What It Checks |
|---|---|
| **Profile Photo** | Whether you have a professional photo with a neutral background |
| **Banner** | Whether you have a custom banner image |
| **Connections** | Your connection count and network strength |
| **Open To Work** | Whether the Open To Work frame is enabled |
| **Location** | Whether your location is filled in |
| **Featured** | Whether you have a Featured section with articles, images, or links |
| **About** | Whether your About/Summary section is filled and above 400 characters |
| **Headline** | Whether your headline is optimized |
| **Experience** | Your work experience entries |
| **Education** | Your education entries |
| **Skills** | Skills listed on your profile |
| **Certificates** | Certifications and courses |
| **Volunteering** | Volunteer experience |
| **LinkedIn URL** | Whether you have a custom LinkedIn URL |

## Section Status Indicators

Each section displays one of three statuses:

- **Looking Good** — This section meets all optimization criteria (shown with a green checkmark)
- **Recommendations** — This section could be improved; expand it to see specific tips (shown in yellow/orange)
- **Needs Work** — Critical items are missing from this section (shown in red)

## Navigating Section Details

Click any section icon on the main panel to open its detail view.

</Frame>

Each detail view includes:

1. Section name and a brief description of what the section covers
2. Status indicator (Looking Good / Recommendations / Needs Work)
3. A short explanation of your current status
4. A **Checklist** of specific items to complete
5. **More Information** with numbered tips explaining why each item matters
6. Two action buttons at the bottom:
   - **Go To Section** — scrolls your LinkedIn page directly to that section
   - **Edit Now** — opens LinkedIn's edit dialog for that section

Use the **&lt;** and **&gt;** arrow buttons to move between sections in sequence, or click **All Sections** to return to the overview panel.

## AI-Powered Generation

Two sections offer AI generation tools to help you write optimized content:

**Generate Headline with AI** — Available from the Headline section. Produces a keyword-rich headline based on your experience and target roles.

**Generate About/Summary with AI** — Available from the About section. A "Generate Using AI — Supercharge your headline" card appears with a **Start Now** button that launches the generation flow.

<Tip>
  Your LinkedIn profile is often the first thing a recruiter sees — even before your resume. A fully optimized profile with an 85%+ score significantly increases your visibility in recruiter searches. Work through each section systematically, starting with the ones marked Needs Work.
