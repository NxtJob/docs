<Tip>
  Optimize your LinkedIn profile first using the [Profile Optimization](/chrome-extension/profile-optimization) tool before exporting. A well-structured LinkedIn profile produces a more complete resume with fewer gaps to fill manually.
</Tip>

Export Profile to Resume converts your LinkedIn profile data into a NxtJob resume in a single click. Instead of retyping your work history, education, and skills, the extension pulls structured data directly from LinkedIn and populates a new resume in the Resume Builder.

This is a **Premium** feature that works best when your LinkedIn account is connected to NxtJob.

## How to Export

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit your LinkedIn profile">
    Navigate to your own LinkedIn profile page in Chrome.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the extension sidebar">
    The NxtJob sidebar opens automatically with the Profile Optimization panel. You will see the **Export Profile to Resume** button (green) at the top of the sidebar, next to the **LinkedIn Connected** indicator.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Export Profile to Resume">
    Click the button. The extension immediately begins extracting your profile data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for the transfer">
    The extension sends your structured profile data to the Resume Builder. This takes a few seconds.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review your new resume">
    A new resume opens at resume.nxtjob.ai with your LinkedIn data pre-filled across all supported sections.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Gets Exported

The extension maps each LinkedIn section to the corresponding section in the Resume Builder:

| LinkedIn Section | Resume Builder Section |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Personal Information (Full Name) |
| **Headline** | Professional Summary / Headline |
| **About** | Professional Summary |
| **Experience** | Work Experience |
| **Education** | Education |
| **Skills** | Skills |
| **Certificates** | Certifications |
| **Volunteering** | Volunteer Experience |
| **Location** | Personal Information (Location) |
| **LinkedIn URL** | Personal Information (LinkedIn URL) |

## After Export

Once the resume opens in the [Resume Builder](/resume-builder/builder), you can:

- Edit and refine each section using the builder interface
- Run a [Resume Score](/resume-builder/resume-score) check to identify areas for improvement
- Use AI features to enhance bullet points and summaries
- Customize the resume for specific job applications

For a full overview of everything available after export, see the [Resume Builder introduction](/resume-builder/introduction).

<Tip>
  Export creates a new resume each time. If you have already exported and want to update specific sections, edit the existing resume directly in the Resume Builder rather than exporting again.
