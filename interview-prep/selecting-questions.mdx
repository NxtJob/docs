## Overview

This is **Step 2 of 3** in the interview setup flow:

Select Job → **Select Questions** → General Settings

The page heading reads "Select your questions" with the subtitle "Add up to 5 questions to the question bank." Here you build the question set for your practice interview by picking from preloaded questions, generating new ones with AI, or typing your own.

## Layout

The screen is split into two side-by-side panels:

- **Left panel — Select Questions**: A scrollable list of preloaded behavioral and situational questions. Each question row has a **+** button on the right to add it to your selection. Once added, the **+** button changes to a green checkmark.
- **Right panel — My Questions (X/5)**: Your selected questions appear here as purple cards. Each card includes an **X** button to remove the question. A **clear all** link at the top right removes every selected question at once. You can drag and drop cards to reorder questions.

## Three Ways to Add Questions

### 1. Preloaded Questions

The question bank contains 50 behavioral questions ready to use. These cover common interview topics such as persuasion, problem-solving, adaptability, decision-making, teamwork, and conflict resolution.

Browse the list in the left panel and click the **+** button next to any question to add it to your selection. The question immediately appears in the My Questions panel on the right.

### 2. Generate with AI

Click the **Generate** button (shown with an AI icon) at the bottom of the right panel to have the AI create questions for you. How this works depends on the previous step:

- **If you selected a job**: The AI reads the job description and generates role-specific questions tailored to the position, required skills, and company context.
- **If you chose Practice without Job**: The AI generates general behavioral questions that are not tied to any particular role.

Generated questions are added directly to your My Questions panel.

### 3. Add Manually

At the bottom of the right panel, the text field labeled "Add your question here" lets you type any question and submit it. Press **Enter** or click the submit icon to add it. Use this for:

- Company-specific questions you have researched ahead of an interview
- Technical questions you expect for your target role
- Follow-up questions from a previous interview round that you want to practice

## Maximum of Five Questions

Each interview session supports a maximum of **5 questions**. If you attempt to add a sixth question, you will see a "Limit Exceeded" alert. Remove an existing question first to make room for a new one.

<Tip>Mix question types for a well-rounded practice session -- combine a few AI-generated job-specific questions with one or two behavioral questions you know are common at your target company.</Tip>

## Navigation

- **Back** returns to [job selection](/interview-prep/practice-with-job).
- **Start Interview** proceeds to [General Settings](/interview-prep/general-settings) where you configure your camera and microphone before the session begins.
