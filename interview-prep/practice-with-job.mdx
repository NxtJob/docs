## Overview

This is **Step 1 of 3** in the interview setup flow:

**Select Job** → Select Questions → General Settings

Before you practice answering questions, you choose whether to tie your session to a specific job. Practicing with a job gives the AI the context it needs to generate targeted, role-specific questions based on the job description.

## Select a Job from the Job Board

The page heading reads "Select job from the job board." Below it, you see job cards pulled from your My Jobs board. Each card displays:

- The **company logo** (or a default building icon if no logo is available)
- The **job title**
- The **company name**

Use the **search bar** at the top to filter jobs by company name. As you type, the grid updates to show only matching results.

Click a job card to select it. A purple border and checkmark confirm your selection. Click the same card again to deselect it.

## Two Paths Forward

After reviewing your jobs, you have two options at the bottom of the screen:

### Start Practicing (with a job selected)

Select a job card and click **Start Practicing**. The AI uses the full job description attached to that job to generate interview questions tailored to the role, company, and required skills. This path produces the most relevant practice experience because every question is grounded in what the employer is actually looking for.

### Practice without Job

Click **Practice without Job** to skip job selection entirely. This creates a general practice session where questions come from the preloaded question bank rather than being generated from a job description. Use this path when you want to practice behavioral or situational interview skills without tying them to a specific role.

## When to Use Each Path

| Path | Best For |
|---|---|
| **With a job** | Preparing for a specific upcoming interview, practicing role-specific technical or behavioral questions, understanding how your experience maps to a particular job description |
| **Without a job** | General interview readiness, practicing common behavioral questions, building confidence with the interview format before targeting a specific role |

<Tip>Practicing with a job produces better, more targeted questions. Save jobs to your Job Board first using the [Chrome Extension](/chrome-extension/saving-jobs), then come here to practice.</Tip>

## Navigation

- **Back** returns you to the [Interview Prep dashboard](/interview-prep/dashboard).
- Selecting a job and clicking **Start Practicing** (or clicking **Practice without Job**) proceeds to [question selection](/interview-prep/selecting-questions).
- If your Job Board is empty, an **Add Job to Board** button appears in place of Start Practicing, linking you to the Job Board so you can save jobs first.
