## Report Overview

After you complete your interview, the AI analyzes every recorded answer and generates a detailed feedback report. This is where Interview Prep delivers its core value -- turning practice into actionable improvement.

## Report Processing

While the AI processes your recordings, a "Preparing your report..." modal appears. You have two options:

- **Refresh** -- Check whether the report is ready.
- **Go to Dashboard** -- Return to the [Dashboard](/interview-prep/dashboard) and come back later. Your report will be waiting when processing finishes.

## Report Layout

Once processing is complete, the report opens with two main areas:

- **Left panel** -- Video playback of your recorded answer with a full transcript below. The transcript highlights **Most Used Keywords** in green and **Filler Words** in orange or red so you can see patterns at a glance.
- **Right panel** -- Three tabs of AI-generated feedback: Content, Vocal Variety, and Body Language.

## Content Tab

The Content tab evaluates **what you said** -- the substance of your answer, its relevance to the question, and how it could be improved.

| Card | What It Measures | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Overall Rating** | Combined score across all dimensions | 0--10 scale. Includes sub-scores for Soft Skill Proficiency and Technical Skill Proficiency. |
| **Candidate Feedback** | Relevance, clarity, feasibility, creativity, and communication | Each criterion is scored individually out of 10 with detailed text feedback explaining the score. |
| **Action Plan** | Specific steps to improve your answer | A list of actionable improvement suggestions you can apply immediately on a retake. |
| **Alternate Answer** | A stronger version of your answer | A full rewritten answer along with an explanation of why it is stronger, broken down by improvement area. |

### Overall Rating Scale

| Score Range | Rating | Color |
|---|---|---|
| Above 7 | Good | Green |
| 5 to 7 | Average | Yellow |
| Below 5 | Needs Improvement | Red |

## Vocal Variety Tab

The Vocal Variety tab evaluates **how you said it** -- your speaking pace, pauses, and filler word usage.

| Card | What It Measures | Rating Scale |
|---|---|---|
| **Average Pace** | Words per minute over time, displayed as a line graph | Good (under 170 wpm), Slightly Fast (170--340 wpm), Fast (above 340 wpm). The chart shows exact time intervals where you spoke too fast or too slow. |
| **Pauses** | Intentional pauses as a percentage of sentences | Good: above 80%, Okay: 60--80%, Need More: below 60%. Pauses are calculated by comparing the number of intentional pauses to the total number of sentences in your transcript. |
| **Filler Words** | Count and distribution of filler words | Good: 0--5 total, Average: 6--10, Bad: above 10. Shows a ranked bar chart of your most-used filler words with individual counts. |

### Tracked Filler Words

The system detects the following filler words and phrases in your transcript: um, uh, like, well, you know, so, basically, actually, honestly, I mean, right, okay, anyway, sort of, kind of, I guess, essentially, in a way, to be honest, as I was saying, at the end of the day, on the other hand, by the way, needless to say, in fact, of course, and I'd say.

## Body Language Tab

The Body Language tab evaluates **non-verbal communication** including eye contact, posture, and gestures. It provides feedback on how your body language supports or detracts from your verbal message, helping you identify habits that may go unnoticed without video review.

---

## Status Indicators

Color-coded dots appear next to every report card throughout all three tabs. Use them for a quick visual scan of your performance:

| Dot Color | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Green | Good |
| Yellow | Average / Okay |
| Red | Bad / Needs Improvement |

## Retaking Questions

At the bottom of each question's report you will find a **Retake Question** button. Clicking it returns you to the [Interview Session](/interview-prep/interview-session) for that specific question. Your new recording replaces the previous one and generates a fresh AI report.

Use the **Previous Question** and **Next Question** buttons to navigate between questions and review each answer's feedback without returning to the dashboard.

<Tip>
Focus on one improvement area at a time. If your first attempt scores low on filler words, retake the question focusing specifically on eliminating filler words before moving to other areas. Targeted practice produces faster improvement than trying to fix everything at once.
