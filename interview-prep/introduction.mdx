## What Is Interview Prep?

NxtJob Interview Prep at [interview.nxtjob.ai](https://interview.nxtjob.ai) is an AI-powered mock interview platform built for senior professionals who want to sharpen their interview skills before high-stakes conversations. Record video answers to interview questions, then receive AI-generated feedback on content quality, vocal delivery, and body language — all without scheduling a live practice partner.

The platform supports two practice modes:

- **Job-based practice** — Select a job from your pipeline and generate interview questions tailored to that specific role, company, and job description.
- **General practice** — Choose from a bank of 50+ preloaded behavioral and situational questions when you want broad preparation without targeting a particular role.

Whether you are preparing for a director-level panel interview or a technical deep-dive with a hiring manager, Interview Prep gives you structured, repeatable practice with objective AI analysis of every answer.
