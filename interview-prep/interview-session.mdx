## Interview Preparation Screen

Once you complete the setup, you land on the Interview Preparation page. The header displays your job context (for example, "Nubra - Frontend Developer") so you always know which role you are practicing for.

## Layout

The session screen is split into two equal halves:

- **Left panel** -- Your live camera feed. This is exactly what the AI will analyze, so position yourself as you would in a real video interview.
- **Right panel** -- The question card displaying the current question and action buttons.

## Device Controls

At the top of the camera area you will find two dropdown menus:

- **Microphone** -- Select the audio input device you want to use.
- **Camera** -- Select the video input device you want to use.

Use these dropdowns for last-minute adjustments if you connected a new headset or switched webcams after starting the interview. Changing a device reloads the camera feed automatically.

## Question Card

The question card on the right side of the screen contains everything you need to navigate and answer questions:

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| **Speaker icon** | Click to have the question read aloud using text-to-speech. Useful if you prefer to listen rather than read. |
| **Question type label** | Indicates the category of the question (for example, Background or Situational). |
| **Question counter** | Shows your position in the interview -- "1/5", "2/5", and so on. |
| **Question text** | The full interview question. |
| **Answer button** | Click to begin recording your response. |

## Recording Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Read the question">
    Take a moment to think through your answer before recording. There is no time limit on how long you can prepare -- only on how long you can record.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Answer">
    A short countdown (3, 2, 1) appears on the camera feed, then camera and microphone recording begins. A red "Recording..." indicator and a timer appear at the top of the screen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deliver your response">
    Speak naturally as you would in a real interview. You have a maximum of 3 minutes (180 seconds) per question. The timer counts up from 00:00 to 03:00. When 30 seconds remain, a red banner warns you of the time left. If you reach the limit, the recording is submitted automatically.

    You must record at least 10 seconds before the Submit Answer button becomes active.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Submit Answer">
    Your recording is uploaded and queued for AI analysis. A progress bar shows the upload status. Once the upload completes, the question status changes to "Processing."
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Navigating Between Questions

After submitting an answer, a **Next Question** button appears. You can also navigate using the **Previous Question** and **Next Question** buttons to move between questions in any order. If you are retaking a question, a **Skip** button lets you move forward without re-recording.

## After All Questions

Once you have answered every question, the Next Question button changes to **View Report**. Clicking it takes you directly to your [Feedback and Report](/interview-prep/feedback-and-report) page where the AI analysis is displayed.

<Tip>
Treat each question as a real interview. Sit up straight, maintain eye contact with the camera, and answer in full sentences. The AI evaluates your body language and delivery alongside your content, so practicing good interview habits here translates directly to better performance in live interviews.
