## Overview

This is **Step 3 of 3** in the interview setup flow:

Select Job → Select Questions → **General Settings**

The page heading reads "General Settings" with the subtitle "Let's check audio, video and speakers." This is the final step before your practice interview begins. Verify that your camera and microphone are working correctly, select the right devices, and confirm that browser permissions are granted.

## Camera Preview

A large video preview area dominates the center of the screen, showing your live webcam feed. Use it to verify your framing, lighting, and background before starting the session.

## Device Selection

At the bottom of the camera preview, three dropdown selectors let you choose your input and output devices:

| Device | What It Controls |
|---|---|
| **Microphone** | Select your audio input device |
| **Speaker** | Select your audio output device |
| **Camera** | Select your video input device |

Click any dropdown to see a list of available devices. The currently active device is highlighted. If you have multiple cameras, microphones, or speakers connected, select the one you want to use for this session.

## Permission Status

Below the camera preview, badges indicate whether your browser has granted access to your camera and microphone:

- **Camera: granted** / **Camera: denied** — green when allowed, red when denied
- **Microphone: granted** / **Microphone: denied** — green when allowed, red when denied

</Frame>

Both permissions must show "granted" before you can start the interview. If either permission is denied, the **Start Interview** button will display an error message indicating which permission is missing.

## What to Do If Permissions Are Denied

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open site settings">
    Click the lock icon (or site settings icon) in your browser address bar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Allow camera and microphone">
    Set both **Camera** and **Microphone** to "Allow."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reload the page">
    Refresh the page so the application can detect the updated permissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify access">
    Return to this step. The permission badges should now show "granted" and your camera feed should appear in the preview area.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Checklist Before Starting

Confirm the following before clicking Start Interview:

- Your camera shows your face clearly in the preview area
- The microphone is picking up your audio (the microphone icon shows an audio level indicator when sound is detected)
- The correct devices are selected if you have multiple cameras or microphones connected
- Both permission badges show "granted"

<Tip>Use a well-lit room with a neutral background. Position your camera at eye level. These environmental factors affect both the video quality and the body language analysis in your interview report.</Tip>

## Navigation

- **Back** returns to [question selection](/interview-prep/selecting-questions).
- **Start Interview** begins the practice interview session. The application tests both video and audio access one final time before launching the interview ground.
