## Dashboard Overview

The interview dashboard at `interview.nxtjob.ai/all` is your home base for managing every mock interview you have created. A welcome banner greets you with "Hello, {name}" alongside a **"Start Practicing"** button to launch a new session. Below, all your interviews are listed in a table with search, sort, and date grouping controls.

## Interview List

Each mock interview in your library appears as a row in the dashboard table. The columns provide a compact summary so you can identify the right session at a glance.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Interview Name** | The name of the mock interview session |
| **Attached Job** | Company logo, job title, and company name (if the interview was generated from a job description) |
| **Status** | **Done** (green) = completed and report ready, **—** (dash) = in progress or not started |
| **Date Added** | When the interview was created |
| **Action** | Three-dot menu for Rename and Delete |

## Date Grouping

Interviews are automatically grouped into time-based sections so you can quickly locate recent sessions:

- **Today**
- **Previous 30 Days**

This grouping makes it easy to find the interview you were working on recently without scanning through your entire list.

## Search and Sort

Two controls at the top of the dashboard help you find the right interview quickly:

- **Search** — The "Search interview name" field filters interviews by name in real time. Type any part of the interview title and the dashboard updates instantly to show matching results.
- **Sort** — The "Date Modified" dropdown controls the display order so you can surface your most recently edited sessions first.

## Starting a New Interview

Click the **"Start Practicing"** button in the welcome banner. This opens the interview setup flow where you choose your practice mode and select questions. See [Practice with a Job](/interview-prep/practice-with-job) for the next step in the workflow.

## Viewing an Existing Interview

Click on any interview row to open its report (if the session is completed) or resume the session where you left off. Completed interviews display a full AI feedback report covering content quality, vocal delivery, and body language analysis.

## Card Actions

Click the three-dot menu on any interview row to access quick actions without opening the session.

### Rename

Opens a dialog with a text field and a **Rename** button. Use descriptive names like "Frontend Dev - Acme Corp - Feb 2026" to keep your list organized as it grows.

<Tip>
Keep interview names descriptive — include the job title and company. When you have completed 10+ mock interviews, the search and sort tools make it easy to find past sessions and track your improvement over time.
