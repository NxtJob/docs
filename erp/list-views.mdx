## Overview

List View is an alternative to the Kanban board that displays opportunities in a tabular format with sortable columns, inline editing, and variant-specific data. Toggle between Kanban and List View using the view switcher in the pipeline toolbar.

List views group opportunities by stage in collapsible sections. Each stage header shows the stage name and opportunity count, and can be expanded or collapsed.
