## Overview

The Group Call tab tracks a client's attendance at group calls and workshops. It's available in the [Opportunity Detail Modal](/erp/opportunity-detail) and is primarily used in the **Operations** and **JFO** pipelines.

## Attendance Records

The tab displays a paginated list of attendance records for the contact. Each record is shown as a card with:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Meeting Date & Time** | Formatted date and time of the group call (e.g., "Jan 15, 2026 · 2:30 PM") |
| **Duration** | Call duration in minutes, shown as a badge (e.g., "45 m") |
| **Added By** | Who recorded the attendance and when |

The header shows the contact's name and **total call count** (e.g., "12 calls").

## Batch Attendance via CSV Upload

Group call attendance is typically recorded in bulk via CSV upload (managed through the operations workflow outside the opportunity modal). The CSV upload:

1. Matches contacts by their contact ID
2. Records the meeting date, time, and duration for each attendee
3. Attributes the upload to the user who performed it

## Pagination

Records load progressively using infinite scroll. As you scroll to the bottom, the next page of records loads automatically (20 records per page). A loading spinner appears while fetching additional records.

## Empty State

If no attendance records exist for the contact, the tab displays: "No attendance records found for this opportunity."

<Tip>
Regular group call attendance is a strong indicator of client engagement. Clients with low attendance may need additional outreach from their assigned A/C Manager or intern.
