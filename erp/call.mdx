## Overview

The Call module tracks every phone call made through the ERP's integrated telephony system. It provides a comprehensive log of all outbound and inbound calls with recording playback, agent attribution, and performance statistics.

### Telephony Integration

The ERP integrates with **Twilio** and **Tata Communications** for call handling:

- **Outbound calls** — Initiated directly from opportunity cards or the call module
- **Call initiation methods** — Phone (direct dial) or Extension (via desk phone)
- **AI Agent calls** — Automated AI-powered calls with optional disposition tracking
- **Recording** — All calls are automatically recorded and stored for playback

### Initiating Calls

Calls can be started from multiple places:

1. **Opportunity card** — Click the phone icon on any opportunity card in the Kanban board
2. **List view** — Use the Call quick-action column in Sales/Operations list views
3. **Opportunity detail modal** — Via the Call Logs tab
4. **Call module** — Direct dial from the Call page

When initiating a call, you can choose between:
- **Phone** — Direct call to the contact's phone number
- **Extension** — Route through your desk extension

Users need the `call:initiate` scope to make outbound calls and the `callScreen:view` scope to access the call interface.

## Call Statistics

At the top of the page, three key metrics are displayed in real-time:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Dialed** (blue) | Total number of calls placed |
| **Picked** (green) | Calls that were answered |
| **Missed** (red) | Calls that went unanswered |

These stats give an instant overview of team calling performance and answer rates.

## Call Log Table

Every call is logged with the following details:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **TO** | The phone number that was called, with a status indicator (green = picked, red = missed) |
| **FROM** | The ERP phone number used to place the call |
| **AGENT/CLIENT** | The team member who made or received the call |
| **DATE & TIME** | Timestamp of the call |
| **RECORDING** | Playback controls for the call recording |

### Recording Playback

Each call row includes built-in audio controls:
- **Play button** — Start playback of the call recording
- **Duration display** — Shows recording length
- **Volume control** — Adjust playback volume
- **Three-dot menu** — Additional recording options (download, share)

### Call Status Indicators

- **Green circle** — Call was picked up / connected
- **Red circle** — Call was missed / not answered

## Call Analytics

The Call module provides analytics with date range and agent filtering:

- **Date range** — Filter analytics by a specific period
- **Agent filter** — View analytics for specific team members
- **Key metrics** — Dialed, picked, missed counts with percentages

## Filtering & Search

The top-right toolbar provides filtering capabilities:

- **Pick a date range** — Filter calls by date range using the calendar picker
- **Search** — Search calls by phone number, agent name, or other criteria
- **Filter icon** — Access advanced filter options
- **Settings gear** — Configure call configuration per user type

## Daily Calling Flow

A typical daily calling workflow for Bookers/Setters:

1. Open the Pipeline and review your assigned leads
2. Click the phone icon on an opportunity card to initiate a call
3. The call is logged automatically with timestamp, duration, and recording
4. After the call, update the opportunity stage and add notes
5. Review your call stats (Dialed/Picked/Missed) at the end of the day
