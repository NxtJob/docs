## Overview

The Users module manages all team members who have access to the ERP. It is divided into two sections: **Users** (full employees) and **Interns** (intern/trainee accounts).

## Users Tab

The Users tab displays all employees in a table format:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Employee name with color-coded avatar initials |
| **Email** | Work email address (typically @nxtjob.ai) |
| **Phone** | Phone number with country code |
| **Role** | Assigned role determining permissions and pipeline access |
| **Action** | Three-dot menu for edit/delete operations |

## User Roles

The ERP defines **7 user roles**. Each role determines which pipelines the user can access and what actions they can perform.

| Role | Pipelines | Owner Field | Permissions |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Admin** | All pipelines | — | Full access: manage users, view all pipelines, configure settings, manage integrations |
| **Booker** | Booker | `booker` | Qualify leads, make calls, book consultations, manage Booker pipeline opportunities |
| **Setter** | Setter, Cold, Webinar | `setter` | Conduct consultations, schedule sales calls, manage Setter/Cold/Webinar pipeline opportunities |
| **Pre-Sales Manager** | Booker, Setter | — | Oversee Booker and Setter teams, review performance, manage pre-sales workflow |
| **Sales Representative** | Sales | `salesRep` | Close deals, process payments, complete EOD forms, manage Sales pipeline opportunities |
| **A/C Manager** | Operations, JFO | `accountManager` | Manage post-sale clients, track progress, oversee interns, manage Ops/JFO pipeline opportunities |
| **Marketing** | All (read access) | — | View pipeline data for campaign analysis, UTM tracking, and marketing attribution |

### Pipeline Ownership Mapping

When an opportunity is assigned to a user, the assignment is stored in a role-specific field:

| Pipeline | Owner Field | Assigned Role |
|---|---|---|
| Booker Pipeline | `booker` | Booker |
| Setter Pipeline | `setter` | Setter |
| Sales Pipeline | `salesRep` | Sales Representative |
| Operations Pipeline | `accountManager` | A/C Manager |
| JFO Pipeline | `accountManager` | A/C Manager |

Cold and Webinar pipelines use the `setter` field through the pipeline owner configuration.

### User Status

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| **Active** | User can log in and access the system |
| **Inactive** | User account is disabled but preserved |
| **Deleted** | User account is permanently removed |

### User Scopes

Users can be granted additional scopes for specific capabilities:

| Scope | Description |
|---|---|
| `call:initiate` | Allows the user to initiate outbound calls |
| `callScreen:view` | Allows the user to view the call screen interface |

### Adding Employees

The Interns tab manages trainee accounts with a similar table layout:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Intern name with color-coded avatar |
| **Email** | Personal email address |
| **Phone** | Phone number |
| **Status** | Account status (Active/Inactive) |
| **Action** | Three-dot menu for management options |

### Managing Interns

- **+ Add Intern** — Add a single intern with their details
- **+ Add Bulk Interns** — Import multiple interns at once for batch onboarding
- **All dropdown** — Filter interns by status (All, Active, Inactive)

Interns are assigned to opportunities in the Operations and JFO pipelines via the `intern` field. They support A/C Managers in client management tasks.
