## Overview

The Cold Pipeline manages leads sourced through **cold outreach** — primarily LinkedIn prospecting and direct contact campaigns. Unlike the Booker Pipeline (which handles inbound ad leads), this pipeline handles outbound prospecting where the team initiates first contact.

**Owner role:** Setter (uses the setter assignment workflow)

## Sales Funnel Position

```
LinkedIn Outreach / Cold Contact → [COLD PIPELINE] → Setter Pipeline (via Setter Call Booked)
```

Qualified cold leads are handed off to the Setter Pipeline through the "Setter Call Booked" stage.

## Stages

The Cold Pipeline has **6 stages**:

| # | Stage | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **LinkedIn Leads** | New leads sourced from LinkedIn outreach campaigns. Entry point. |
| 2 | **No Response** | Leads who haven't responded to outreach attempts. |
| 3 | **Wrong Number** | Leads with invalid contact information. |
| 4 | **Followup** | Leads who need a follow-up attempt at a later date. |
| 5 | **Setter Call Booked** | Leads who have agreed to a consultation call with a Setter. **Handoff stage.** |
| 6 | **Junk Lead** | Disqualified leads. Terminal stage. |

## Workflow

### Cold Outreach Flow

1. **Import LinkedIn leads** — Add new prospects from LinkedIn sourcing to the LinkedIn Leads stage
2. **Initial outreach** — Contact leads via LinkedIn messages, phone, or email
3. **Follow up** — Move unresponsive leads to Followup for later attempts
4. **Book setter call** — For interested prospects, book a consultation and move to Setter Call Booked
5. **Disqualify** — Move irrelevant leads to Junk Lead

### Handoff to Setter

When a cold lead reaches **Setter Call Booked**, the lead transitions to the Setter Pipeline where the standard consultation process begins.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | What to Track |
|---|---|
| **Response rate** | Percentage of LinkedIn Leads that respond to outreach |
| **Setter Call Booked rate** | Percentage of leads that convert to booked calls |
| **Followup conversion** | How many follow-up leads eventually engage |
| **Junk Lead rate** | Percentage of leads that are junk — indicates sourcing quality |

<Tip>
Use the [Filters](/erp/filters) with "Last Communication Date" to identify leads that haven't been contacted recently and may need a follow-up attempt.
