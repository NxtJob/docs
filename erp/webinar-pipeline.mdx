**Owner role:** Setter (uses the setter assignment workflow)

## Sales Funnel Position

```
Webinar Registration → [WEBINAR PIPELINE] → (Booked 1-on-1 Calls → Sales Pipeline)
```

Webinar leads who book a 1-on-1 call are progressed through the pipeline and eventually handed off to the Sales Pipeline.

## Stages

The Webinar Pipeline has **6 stages**:

| # | Stage | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Webinar Registration** | Leads who have registered for an upcoming webinar. Entry point. |
| 2 | **Attended Webinar** | Leads who actually attended the webinar. |
| 3 | **SAB Registration** | Leads who registered for the Strategy and Blueprint session after the webinar. |
| 4 | **Booked 1-on-1 Calls** | Leads who have booked a 1-on-1 consultation call. |
| 5 | **Call Happened** | The 1-on-1 consultation call has taken place. |
| 6 | **WINS** | Leads who converted to a sale. Terminal success stage. |

## Workflow

### Webinar Funnel Flow

1. **Registration** — Leads register for a webinar (captured automatically from the registration form)
2. **Attendance tracking** — After the webinar, mark attendees by moving them to Attended Webinar
3. **SAB follow-up** — Invite attendees to the Strategy and Blueprint session
4. **Book consultations** — For engaged attendees, schedule 1-on-1 calls
5. **Conduct calls** — Complete the consultation and move to Call Happened
6. **Track wins** — Move converted leads to WINS

### Conversion Path

```
Webinar Registration → Attended Webinar → SAB Registration → Booked 1-on-1 Calls → Call Happened → WINS
```

Not all leads follow every stage — some may skip from Attended Webinar directly to Booked 1-on-1 Calls.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | What to Track |
|---|---|
| **Registration → Attendance rate** | Percentage of registrants who actually attend |
| **Attendance → SAB rate** | Percentage of attendees who register for SAB |
| **SAB → Booked Call rate** | Percentage of SAB registrants who book 1-on-1 calls |
| **Overall conversion rate** | Registration → WINS conversion percentage |

<Tip>
The biggest drop-off is typically between Registration and Attendance. Send reminder emails and SMS leading up to the webinar to maximize attendance rates.
