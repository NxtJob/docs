## Overview

The Calendar module provides a full-featured scheduling interface integrated with Google Calendar. Team members can view, create, and manage appointments across the organization with real-time sync.

The Calendar page has two sub-sections accessible via tabs at the top: **Calendar** (the scheduling view) and **Calendar Settings** (calendar management).

### View Modes

| View | Description |
|---|---|
| **Day** | Single day view showing all time slots |
| **Week** | Full week overview (default) with days as columns |
| **Month** | Monthly overview for long-range planning |

### Navigation

- **Month/Year display** — Shows the current month and year (e.g., "Feb 2026")
- **Arrow buttons** — Navigate forward/backward by day, week, or month
- **Today button** — Jump back to the current date
- **Column Width** — Toggle between "Wide" and compact column layouts

### Appointments

Appointments appear as color-coded blocks on the calendar:

- **Blue blocks** — Standard appointments (e.g., "Rupesh Chandra <> Ajay Singh")
- **Red blocks** — Career strategy calls or flagged appointments
- **Green blocks** — Other appointment types
- Each block shows the **participant names** and **time range** (e.g., "10:00 am - 11:00 am")
- Click on any appointment block to view or edit its details

### Creating Appointments

Click the **+ New** button in the top-right corner to create a new appointment. You can also book appointments directly from an opportunity's **Book Appointment** tab in the Pipeline module.

### Sidebar Filters

The right sidebar provides two filter sections:

**Mini Calendar**
A compact monthly calendar for quick date navigation. The current date is highlighted with a circle. Click any date to jump to that day's view.

**Users / Calendars Toggle**
- **Users tab** — Filter appointments by specific team members. Checkboxes let you show/hide individual users' appointments.
- **Calendars tab** — Filter by calendar type to show only specific calendar categories.
- **Search** — Search for users by name to quickly find and filter.

Calendar Settings displays a management table for all calendars in the system:

| Column | Description |

| **Date Updated** | When the calendar was last modified |
| **Action Dropdown** | Three-dot menu for edit/delete actions |

### Creating a Calendar

Click **Create Calendar** in the top-right corner to add a new calendar. Each calendar can be:
- Named for a specific team member, purpose, or appointment type
- Set to Active or Inactive
- Configured with its own scheduling rules

### Scheduling Types

Calendars support different scheduling modes:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **Pick Member** | The booker/setter manually selects which team member to book the appointment with |
| **Round Robin** | The system automatically assigns the appointment to the next available team member in rotation |

### Availability Management

Each user's availability is managed per calendar:

- Users set their available time slots for each day of the week
- Google Calendar events automatically block time slots
- Availability is checked in real-time when booking from the opportunity's Book Appointment tab

### Search

Use the search bar next to the "Create Calendar" button to find calendars by name.
