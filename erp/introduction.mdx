## What Is NxtJob ERP?

NxtJob ERP is the internal operations platform at [erp.nxtjob.ai](https://erp.nxtjob.ai) that powers the entire sales-to-operations pipeline. It manages lead qualification, sales calls, payment processing, client onboarding, and job search tracking — all in a single system.

## Sales Funnel Flow

Every lead flows through a structured funnel from acquisition to client success:

```
Facebook/LinkedIn Ad
        ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Booker Pipeline    │  Booker qualifies → books consultation
└────────┬────────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Setter Pipeline    │  Setter conducts consultation → schedules sales call
└────────┬────────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Sales Pipeline     │  Sales Rep closes deal → processes payment
└────────┬────────────┘
         ↓ (auto-created on payment)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Operations Pipeline  OR  JFO Pipeline  │  A/C Manager manages client success
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Additional entry points:
- **[Cold Pipeline](/erp/cold-pipeline)** — LinkedIn cold outreach → feeds into Setter Pipeline
- **[Webinar Pipeline](/erp/webinar-pipeline)** — Webinar registrations → 1-on-1 calls → conversion
