## Overview

The LinkedIn Conversations tab provides a **split-panel chat interface** for viewing a client's LinkedIn conversations directly within the [Opportunity Detail Modal](/erp/opportunity-detail). This is used by A/C Managers and interns to monitor client outreach activity without leaving the ERP.

## Layout

The tab uses a split-panel design:

| Panel | Width | Content |
|---|---|---|
| **Thread List** (left) | 35% | List of all LinkedIn conversation threads |
| **Chat View** (right) | 65% | Messages for the selected thread |

### Header

The top header bar shows:

- **"LinkedIn Conversations"** title
- **Average message count** badge (e.g., "Avg. 4 messages") — indicates the average conversation length across all threads

## Thread List (Left Panel)

Each thread in the left panel displays:

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| **Contact Name** | Clickable LinkedIn profile link (opens in new tab) |
| **Latest Message Date** | Timestamp of the most recent message |
| **Message Preview** | Truncated text of the latest message |
| **"You:" prefix** | Appears if the last message was sent by the client |

Threads are listed in chronological order. Clicking a thread selects it and loads its messages in the right panel. The selected thread is highlighted with a left border accent.

## Chat View (Right Panel)

### Conversation Header

Shows the selected contact's name (linked to their LinkedIn profile) and total message count.

### Message Bubbles

Messages are displayed as chat bubbles:

| Sender | Alignment | Style |
|---|---|---|
| **Client (outgoing)** | Right-aligned | Primary color background |
| **Contact (incoming)** | Left-aligned | Gray background, shows sender name |

Each message shows:
- **Sender name** (for incoming messages only)
- **Message content** — Full text with whitespace preserved
- **Timestamp** — Delivery date/time in the bottom-right corner

### Empty States

| State | Display |
|---|---|
| **No threads** | LinkedIn icon with "No LinkedIn conversations" message |
| **No thread selected** | Message icon with "Select a conversation to view messages" |
| **Empty conversation** | Alert icon with "No messages in this conversation" |

## Data Source

Conversations are fetched using the contact's **email address** to match their NxtJob account with their LinkedIn activity. The data comes from the LinkedIn integration that tracks outreach messages sent through the NxtJob platform.

<Tip>
Use this tab during weekly reviews with clients to identify which LinkedIn conversations are active and which contacts need follow-up. The average message count metric helps gauge overall engagement quality.
