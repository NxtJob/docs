## Overview

The Setter Pipeline receives qualified leads from the Booker Pipeline. Setters conduct initial consultations, assess the lead's needs, and schedule sales calls with the Sales team for qualified prospects.

**Owner role:** Setter (`setter` field on the opportunity)

## Sales Funnel Position

```
Booker Pipeline → [SETTER PIPELINE] → Sales Pipeline → Operations/JFO
```

The Setter's goal is to **conduct consultations and schedule sales calls**. Qualified leads who complete their consultation are moved to the Sales Pipeline.

## Stages

The Setter Pipeline has **8 stages**:

| # | Stage | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **New Lead** | Leads handed off from the Booker Pipeline with a booked consultation call. |
| 2 | **Workshop** | Leads who have been invited to or attended a workshop/webinar session. |
| 3 | **No Response** | Leads who haven't responded to the Setter's outreach after the initial booking. |
| 4 | **Follow Up** | Leads who need a follow-up call or are not ready to schedule a sales call yet. |
| 5 | **Wrong Number** | Leads with invalid contact information discovered during setter outreach. |
| 6 | **Call Scheduled** | Leads who have a sales call scheduled with a Sales Representative. **This is the handoff stage.** |
| 7 | **Unqualified Lead** | Leads who don't meet the qualification criteria after the consultation. |
| 8 | **Junk Lead** | Disqualified leads (spam, not interested, duplicate). Terminal stage. |

## Workflow

### Daily Setter Flow

1. **Review New Leads** — Check leads handed off from Booker Pipeline
2. **Conduct consultations** — Call the lead, understand their needs, and fill in the [Client Persona](/erp/client-persona)
3. **Qualify the prospect** — Assess if the lead is a fit for NxtJob programs
4. **Schedule sales call** — If qualified, book a sales call and move to Call Scheduled
5. **Categorize others** — Move to Follow Up, No Response, Unqualified Lead, or Junk Lead

### Consultation Process

During the setter consultation, the setter should:

1. Review the lead's background from the Booker's notes
2. Complete the [Client Persona](/erp/client-persona) tab with career details, salary information, and commitment level
3. Assess qualification criteria (experience, employment status, financial readiness)
4. If qualified, explain the NxtJob program and schedule a sales call
5. Book the appointment using the [Book Appointment](/erp/opportunity-detail) tab

### Handoff to Sales

When a lead reaches the **Call Scheduled** stage:
- The opportunity appears in the Sales Pipeline as **Call Booked**
- The Sales Representative is assigned as the new owner (`salesRep` field)
- The Setter's assignment is preserved for attribution
- The Client Persona data is available for the sales rep to review

## Key Metrics

| Metric | What to Track |
|---|---|
| **New Lead → Call Scheduled rate** | Percentage of leads that convert to scheduled sales calls |
| **Consultation completion rate** | How many consultations are actually conducted vs. no-shows |
| **Unqualified Lead rate** | Percentage of leads that don't qualify — may indicate Booker qualification needs improvement |
| **Average time in pipeline** | How long leads stay before being scheduled or disqualified |

<Tip>
Always fill in the [Client Persona](/erp/client-persona) during the consultation — the Sales team relies on this data to personalize their pitch. Pay special attention to the "Biggest Career Concern" and "Employment Status" fields.
