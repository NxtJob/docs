## Overview

The Job Force One (JFO) Pipeline manages clients enrolled in the **Job Force One program** — NxtJob's premium job placement service. Opportunities arrive here automatically when a sale is closed in the Sales Pipeline with "Job Force One" selected as the program type.

The JFO pipeline mirrors the Operations pipeline stages but has its own **phase-based list view system** that tracks clients through structured job search phases.

**Owner role:** A/C Manager (`accountManager` field on the opportunity)

## Stages

The JFO Pipeline has **7 stages** (identical structure to Operations):

| # | Stage | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Active** | Client is actively engaged in the JFO program. Entry point. |
| 2 | **Inactive** | Client has become inactive or unresponsive. |
| 3 | **On Break** | Client has requested a temporary break. |
| 4 | **Defaulter** | Client has missed payments or violated terms. |
| 5 | **Dropout** | Client has dropped out of the program. |
| 6 | **Failed** | Client completed the program without achieving placement. |
| 7 | **Successful** | Client achieved job placement. Terminal success stage. |

## JFO Phase System

The JFO program follows a **structured phase progression** that's tracked through the list view:

### Phase 0 — Onboarding & Resume

The initial setup phase where the client's resume is reviewed and approved.

- Resume review and approval
- Profile setup and optimization
- Orientation to the JFO program and tools

### Phase 1 — Network Building

The client builds their professional network through strategic outreach.

Key metrics tracked:
- Network type engagement (counts by network type)
- Company type engagement (counts by company type)
- Accept rates, engagement rates, referral rates
- Phase progress (days in phase)

### Phase 2 — Job Search & Interviews

Active job searching with a focus on interviews and offers.

Key metrics tracked:
- Hidden jobs unlocked (target companies and recruitment agencies)
- Screening calls
- Interviews (with proof upload)
- Offers received
- Phase progress

### Phase 3 — Negotiation & Placement

Final phase focused on salary negotiation and accepting an offer.

Key metrics tracked:
- Salary comparison (current vs. offered)
- Negotiation status
- Phase progress

## JFO List View

The JFO pipeline uses a dedicated [List View](/erp/list-views) with **6 phase-based variants**:

| Variant | Description |
|---|---|
| **All Phases** | Overview across all phases with common columns |
| **Phase 0** | Resume approval and onboarding tracking |
| **Phase 1** | Network building metrics and connection statistics |
| **Phase 2** | Job search progress — interviews, offers, screenings |
| **Phase 3** | Negotiation tracking and salary details |
| **Payment** | Payment status, amounts, and instalment schedules |

Switch between variants using the dropdown selector in the list view toolbar.

## Workflow

### A/C Manager JFO Flow

1. **Onboard new clients** — Review their resume, approve for Phase 0 completion
2. **Guide through phases** — Support clients as they progress from networking to job search
3. **Monitor metrics** — Use [JS Metrics](/erp/js-metrics) and the phase list views to track weekly progress
4. **Review LinkedIn activity** — Check [LinkedIn Conversations](/erp/linkedin-conversations) for outreach quality
5. **Track attendance** — Monitor [Group Call](/erp/group-call) attendance for engagement
6. **Celebrate wins** — Move successful clients to the Successful stage

### Phase Progression

```
Phase 0 (Resume) → Phase 1 (Network) → Phase 2 (Job Search) → Phase 3 (Negotiation) → Successful
```

Phase transitions are tracked through the list view's phase progress indicator, which shows the number of days spent in each phase.

## Key Tabs

For JFO clients, the most critical tabs in the [Opportunity Detail Modal](/erp/opportunity-detail) are:

- **[JS Metrics](/erp/js-metrics)** — Weekly reachouts, accept %, engagement %, referral %, screenings, interviews, offers
- **[LinkedIn Conversations](/erp/linkedin-conversations)** — Monitor outreach message quality and response rates
- **[Group Call](/erp/group-call)** — Verify attendance at coaching calls and workshops
- **[Client Persona](/erp/client-persona)** — Reference client background for personalized coaching

## Key Metrics

| Metric | What to Track |
|---|---|
| **Placement rate** | Percentage of Active clients who reach Successful |
| **Average time to placement** | Days from Active to Successful |
| **Phase 1 → Phase 2 time** | How quickly clients build their network |
| **Interview-to-offer rate** | Phase 2 conversion efficiency |
| **Dropout rate** | Percentage of JFO clients who drop out |

<Tip>
The Phase 1 list view is particularly useful for weekly reviews — clients whose network metrics plateau may need coaching on messaging strategy or target audience selection.
