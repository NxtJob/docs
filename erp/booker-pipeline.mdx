## Overview

The Booker Pipeline is the **first stage of the sales funnel**. Leads arrive from Facebook ads, LinkedIn campaigns, and other marketing channels. Bookers qualify these leads through cold calling and move qualified prospects to the Setter Pipeline for consultation scheduling.

**Owner role:** Booker (`booker` field on the opportunity)

## Sales Funnel Position

```
Facebook/LinkedIn Ad → [BOOKER PIPELINE] → Setter Pipeline → Sales Pipeline → Operations/JFO
```

The Booker's goal is to **qualify leads and book consultation calls** with Setters. Once a call is booked, the lead moves to the Setter Pipeline.

## Stages

The Booker Pipeline has **10 stages**:

| # | Stage | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Facebook Lead** | New leads from Facebook ad campaigns. This is the primary entry point for most leads. |
| 2 | **LinkedIn Lead** | New leads from LinkedIn ad campaigns and outreach. |
| 3 | **Cold Calling** | Leads currently being contacted via cold calls. Bookers actively dial these leads. |
| 4 | **Software** | Leads who have interacted with NxtJob software products (Resume Builder, Job Board, etc.). |
| 5 | **No Response** | Leads who haven't answered calls or responded to outreach after multiple attempts. |
| 6 | **Wrong Number** | Leads with invalid or incorrect phone numbers. |
| 7 | **Follow Up** | Leads who need a follow-up call at a later date. |
| 8 | **Awaiting Rebook** | Leads whose initial booking fell through and need rescheduling. |
| 9 | **Call Booked** | Qualified leads who have a consultation call booked with a Setter. **This is the handoff stage.** |
| 10 | **Junk Lead** | Disqualified leads (spam, not interested, duplicate, etc.). Terminal stage. |

## Workflow

### Daily Booker Flow

1. **Check new leads** — Review Facebook Lead and LinkedIn Lead stages for fresh leads
2. **Start cold calling** — Move leads to Cold Calling and begin dialing
3. **Qualify the lead** — During the call, assess if the lead is a fit for NxtJob services
4. **Book a consultation** — If qualified, book a setter call and move to Call Booked
5. **Categorize unqualified** — Move to No Response, Wrong Number, Follow Up, or Junk Lead

### Handoff to Setter

When a lead reaches the **Call Booked** stage:
- The opportunity is visible to Setters in the Setter Pipeline as a **New Lead**
- The Booker's assignment (`booker` field) is preserved on the opportunity for attribution
- The Setter is assigned as the new owner

## Key Metrics

| Metric | What to Track |
|---|---|
| **Lead → Call Booked rate** | Percentage of new leads that result in booked calls |
| **Cold Calling volume** | Number of calls made per day |
| **Junk Lead rate** | Percentage of leads that are junk — high rates may indicate ad targeting issues |
| **Follow Up conversion** | How many follow-up leads eventually book calls |

<Tip>
Focus on the Facebook Lead and LinkedIn Lead stages first each morning — fresh leads have the highest contact rate. Use the [Filters](/erp/filters) to sort by "Created At" to prioritize the newest leads.
