## Overview

The JS Metrics (Job Search Metrics) tab displays weekly performance data for a client's job search activity. It's available in the [Opportunity Detail Modal](/erp/opportunity-detail) and is primarily used in the **Operations** and **JFO** pipelines to track client progress.

## Data Source

Metrics are fetched based on the contact's **email** and **Job Search Warm Up date**. The Warm Up date defines Week 1 of the client's job search — all weekly data is calculated relative to this starting point.

<Note>
If the Job Search Warm Up date is not set for a contact, the system defaults to today's date and shows a warning banner.
</Note>

## Metrics Table Layout

The tab displays a scrollable table with:

- **Rows** = Metric types (13 rows)
- **Columns** = Weeks (Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, etc.)

The first column (Metric name) is sticky and always visible during horizontal scrolling. Each week column shows the label and date range.

## Weekly Metrics Reference

| # | Metric | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Reachouts (sent)** | Count | Total LinkedIn connection requests / messages sent |
| 2 | **Companies** | Count | Unique companies reached out to |
| 3 | **Accept** | Count | Connection requests accepted |
| 4 | **Accept %age** | Percentage | Accept / Reachouts × 100 |
| 5 | **Engaged** | Count | Contacts who responded or engaged |
| 6 | **Engage %age** | Percentage | Engaged / Accept × 100 |
| 7 | **Referred** | Count | Contacts who provided a referral |
| 8 | **Referral %age** | Percentage | Referred / Engaged × 100 |
| 9 | **Screenings** | Count | Screening calls scheduled |
| 10 | **Screening %age** | Percentage | Screenings / Referred × 100 |
| 11 | **Interviews** | Count | Formal interviews conducted |
| 12 | **Interview %age** | Percentage | Interviews / Screenings × 100 |
| 13 | **Offers** | Count | Job offers received |

## Funnel Progression

The metrics follow a **conversion funnel**:

```
Reachouts → Accept → Engaged → Referred → Screenings → Interviews → Offers
```

Each percentage metric measures the conversion rate from the previous stage to the current one. This helps identify where in the job search funnel a client may be struggling.

## Usage

### A/C Managers (Operations/JFO)

- Review weekly during client check-ins to assess progress
- Identify weeks with drops in activity or conversion rates
- Use percentage metrics to coach clients on improving their approach

### Sales Representatives

- Reference metrics when discussing client success stories with prospects
- Use aggregate data to validate the program's effectiveness

## States

| State | Display |
|---|---|
| **Loading** | Spinner animation |
| **Error** | "Failed to load metrics" with retry suggestion |
| **No data** | "No metrics data available — Metrics will appear once job search activity begins" |
| **Data available** | Full scrollable metrics table |

<Tip>
Pay attention to the Accept %age and Engage %age columns — these are the earliest indicators of whether a client's outreach strategy is working. A drop below 20% accept rate usually signals a need for profile or messaging optimization.
