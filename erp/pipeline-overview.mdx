## Overview

The Pipeline module is the heart of NxtJob ERP. It provides a Kanban-style board where every lead (called an **opportunity**) is represented as a card that moves through defined stages. Each pipeline represents a different team or workflow in the NxtJob sales funnel.

## Switching Pipelines

Use the dropdown at the top-left to switch between pipelines. The ERP supports seven pipelines:

</Frame>

| Pipeline | Owner Role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [**Booker Pipeline**](/erp/booker-pipeline) | Booker | Initial lead qualification from Facebook/LinkedIn ads |
| [**Setter Pipeline**](/erp/setter-pipeline) | Setter | Consultation scheduling with qualified leads |
| [**Sales Pipeline**](/erp/sales-pipeline) | Sales Representative | Deal closing, payment tracking, and EOD reporting |
| [**Operations Pipeline**](/erp/operations-pipeline) | A/C Manager | Post-sale client management and success tracking |
| [**Cold Pipeline**](/erp/cold-pipeline) | Setter | Cold outreach via LinkedIn and direct contact |
| [**Webinar Pipeline**](/erp/webinar-pipeline) | Setter | Leads from webinar registrations and attendees |
| [**Job Force One Pipeline**](/erp/jfo-pipeline) | A/C Manager | Specialized job placement program tracking |

Each pipeline displays a total opportunity count (e.g., "1430 Opportunities") and has its own set of stages shown as columns.

## Kanban Board

### Pipeline Stages

Stages are the columns on the Kanban board. Each stage shows:

- **Stage name** (e.g., Facebook Lead, Cold Calling, Call Booked)
- **Opportunity count** per stage
- **Color-coded header bar** for visual distinction

Opportunities move between stages by **drag-and-drop**. Drag a card from one column to another to update its stage. Certain stage transitions in the Sales pipeline trigger an [EOD Form](/erp/eod-form) that must be completed.

### Opportunity Cards

Each opportunity card provides at-a-glance information and quick actions:

- **Contact name** — The lead's name prominently displayed
- **Assigned user badge** — Color-coded initials of the assigned team member
- **Quick-action icons** — Call, notes count, documents, tasks, email, chat, and more
- **Notification badges** — Red/blue badges indicate pending items (e.g., unread notes, overdue tasks)
- **Checkbox** — Select opportunities for bulk operations
- **Three-dot menu** — Additional actions per card

Click on any opportunity's name to open the [Opportunity Detail Modal](/erp/opportunity-detail).

## Views Toggle

Each pipeline supports two view modes:

| View | Description |
|---|---|
| **Kanban** | Default drag-and-drop board with stage columns |
| **List View** | Tabular view with sortable columns, variant-specific data, and inline editing |

Toggle between views using the view switcher in the toolbar. See [List Views](/erp/list-views) for details on each pipeline's list view variants.

## Sorting

Click the **Sort** button in the toolbar to reorder opportunities within stages. Available sort options:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| **Created At** | Sort by when the opportunity was created |
| **Updated At** | Sort by the most recent update |
| **Opportunity Name** | Alphabetical sorting by contact name |

## Bulk Assign

Select multiple opportunity checkboxes, then use **Bulk Assign** to reassign them to a different team member in one action. This is useful when redistributing leads between team members.

## Advanced Filters

Click **Advanced Filters** in the toolbar to open the filter panel. Filters narrow down displayed opportunities using powerful rules with AND/OR logic.

See [Filters](/erp/filters) for the complete list of 28+ filter conditions.

## Adding Opportunities

Click the **+ Add Opportunity** button in the top-right corner to create a new lead. The form collects:

| Field | Description |

| **Contact Name** | Lead's full name (required) |
| **Contact Email** | Email address (required) |
| **Contact Phone** | Phone number with country code (required) |
| **Pipeline** | Which pipeline to place the opportunity in (required) |
| **Pipeline Stage** | Initial stage within the pipeline (required) |
| **Owner** | Assigned team member |
| **Tags** | Classification tags (e.g., salary ranges) |
| **Job Title** | Lead's current job title |
| **Experience** | Years of experience |
| **UTM Source** | Lead acquisition source |
| **UTM Medium** | Lead acquisition medium |
| **Payment Fields** | Amount paid, outstanding amount, instalment dates (for paid stages) |

## Export

Click the three-dot menu next to the "+ Add Opportunity" button to access **Export Opportunities**, which exports your current pipeline data as a downloadable file.

<Tip>
Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate faster: click a card to preview it, use the pipeline dropdown to switch contexts, and combine filters with sort to find exactly the opportunities you need.
