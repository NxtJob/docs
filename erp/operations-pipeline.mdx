## Overview

The Operations Pipeline manages clients **after they've paid** for a standard NxtJob program (non-JFO). Opportunities arrive here automatically when a sale is closed in the Sales Pipeline. A/C Managers oversee client onboarding, track progress, and manage the client through to successful job placement or program completion.

**Owner role:** A/C Manager (`accountManager` field on the opportunity)

## Stages

The Operations Pipeline has **7 stages**:

| # | Stage | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Active** | Client is actively engaged in the program. Entry point for new clients. |
| 2 | **Inactive** | Client has become inactive or unresponsive. Needs re-engagement. |
| 3 | **On Break** | Client has requested a temporary break from the program. |
| 4 | **Defaulter** | Client has missed payments or violated program terms. |
| 5 | **Dropout** | Client has dropped out of the program. |
| 6 | **Failed** | Client completed the program but did not achieve the desired outcome. |
| 7 | **Successful** | Client achieved their goal (job placement, career transition, etc.). Terminal success stage. |

## Workflow

### A/C Manager Daily Flow

1. **Check Active clients** — Review client progress, upcoming milestones, and group call attendance
2. **Monitor Inactive** — Reach out to inactive clients to re-engage them
3. **Track payments** — Verify payment instalments are on schedule using the Payment list view
4. **Review intern performance** — Check intern assignments and their impact on client outcomes
5. **Update milestones** — Progress clients through milestones as they achieve goals

### Client Lifecycle

```
Active → (engaged) → Successful
Active → (unresponsive) → Inactive → (re-engaged) → Active
Active → (requested) → On Break → (returned) → Active
Active → (payment issues) → Defaulter
Active → (quit) → Dropout
Active → (completed, no success) → Failed
```

## List View Variants

The Operations pipeline offers **5 list view variants** for different management perspectives. See [List Views](/erp/list-views) for detailed column descriptions.

| Variant | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Default** | Core overview — owner, intern, milestone, agreement, remaining days |
| **Job Search Progress** | Track client's job search activity — videos watched, network metrics, resume approval |
| **Payment** | Monitor payment status — amounts, instalments, outstanding balances |
| **Client Success Resources** | Track resources shared — bi-weekly email proofs, dashboard links |
| **Intern Performance** | Evaluate intern impact — WIN counts, milestone progress |

### Payment Status Types

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| **Full Payment** | Client has paid the full program amount |
| **Partial Payment** | Client has paid partially with outstanding instalments |
| **PDC** | Post-dated cheque received |

## Key Tabs

For each client opportunity, the most relevant tabs are:

- **[JS Metrics](/erp/js-metrics)** — Weekly job search performance data
- **[LinkedIn Conversations](/erp/linkedin-conversations)** — Monitor client outreach
- **[Group Call](/erp/group-call)** — Track attendance at group sessions
- **[Client Persona](/erp/client-persona)** — Reference client background for personalized support

## Key Metrics

| Metric | What to Track |
|---|---|
| **Active → Successful rate** | Percentage of clients who achieve their goal |
| **Dropout rate** | Percentage of clients who leave the program early |
| **Average time to success** | How long it takes active clients to reach Successful |
| **Defaulter rate** | Percentage of clients with payment issues |
| **Intern utilization** | How effectively interns are supporting client outcomes |

<Tip>
Use the "Job Search Progress" list view variant for weekly team reviews. Sort by network metrics to quickly identify which clients need additional coaching on their outreach strategy.
