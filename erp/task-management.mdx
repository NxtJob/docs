## Overview

The Task Management module provides a board-based system for creating, assigning, and tracking tasks across the team. Tasks can be linked to specific contacts/opportunities and organized into boards that correspond to different teams or workflows.

## Task Table

Tasks are displayed in a table with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Task Name** | Prefixed with a board code (e.g., "BKR-2") followed by the task title. Click the edit icon to modify. |
| **Status** | Current status with a color-coded badge (e.g., "To Do" in green). Click to change status. |
| **Due Date** | Calendar date when the task is due |
| **Contact** | Linked contact/opportunity shown by their initials badge |
| **Assignee** | Team member(s) assigned to the task, shown as avatar badges |

## Boards

Tasks are organized into **boards** that map to team functions. The board prefix in the task name indicates which board the task belongs to.

### Board Prefix Mapping

| Prefix | Board | Pipeline |
|---|---|---|
| **BKR** | Booker | Booker Pipeline |
| **STR** | Setter | Setter Pipeline |
| **SLS** | Sales | Sales Pipeline |
| **OPS** | Operations | Operations Pipeline |
| **JFO** | Job Force One | JFO Pipeline |
| **CLD** | Cold | Cold Pipeline |
| **WBN** | Webinar | Webinar Pipeline |

For example, a task named "BKR-2" is the 2nd task in the Booker board.

### Selecting Boards

Use the **Selected Boards** dropdown in the top-right corner to filter which boards' tasks are visible. The dropdown shows the count of currently selected boards (e.g., "Selected Boards (1)").

## User Filters

The toolbar displays colored avatar circles for team members. Click on any avatar to filter tasks assigned to that specific user. The **+28** badge indicates additional users beyond those shown.

## Filter

Click the **filter icon** (funnel) next to the user avatars to access advanced filtering options for tasks.

## Creating Tasks

Click **+ Add Task** at the bottom of the task list to create a new task. When creating a task, you can:

- Set a **task name/title**
- Choose a **status** (To Do, In Progress, Done, etc.)
- Set a **due date**
- Link to a **contact** or opportunity
- Assign to one or more **team members**

## Search

Use the **Search** bar at the top-left to find tasks by name or content.

<Tip>
Tasks can also be created directly from an opportunity's detail modal in the Pipeline module, automatically linking the task to that specific contact.
