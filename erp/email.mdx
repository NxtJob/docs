## Overview

The Email module provides a shared team inbox for managing customer email conversations. It supports assignment workflows, status tracking, and conversation threading so no customer email goes unanswered.

## Email Tabs

The top navigation bar categorizes emails into workflow stages:

| Tab | Description |
|---|---|
| **All** | Every email conversation across all statuses |
| **Unassigned** | Emails that haven't been assigned to a team member yet |
| **Mine** | Emails assigned to the currently logged-in user |
| **Drafts** | Email drafts that haven't been sent |
| **Needs Attention** | Emails flagged as requiring urgent response |
| **Assigned** | Emails that have been assigned to a team member |
| **Closed** | Resolved/completed email conversations |
| **Snoozed** | Emails temporarily hidden and set to resurface later |

## Conversation List

Each email thread displays:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Checkbox** | Select emails for bulk actions |
| **Unread indicator** | Blue dot for unread conversations |
| **Customer** | The customer's email address |
| **Conversation** | Email subject line (bold) with a preview of the email body below |
| **Status** | "Waiting for: X days" showing how long the customer has been waiting for a response |

## Quick Actions

Each email row has a set of quick-action icons on the right side:

- **Assign** — Assign the conversation to a team member
- **Flag** — Flag for follow-up or priority
- **Snooze** — Temporarily hide and set a reminder
- **Reply** — Quick reply to the conversation
- **Archive/Close** — Close the conversation

## Composing Emails

Click the **Compose** button (with edit icon) to create a new email. The compose interface allows you to write and send emails from the shared team inbox.

## Filtering

- **Account selector** — The dropdown in the top-right (e.g., "support@nxtjob.ai") lets you switch between different email accounts
- **Search** — Search emails by subject or content using the search bar
- **Filter by assigned user** — Dropdown to filter conversations by the team member they're assigned to

## Pagination

The bottom of the email list shows pagination controls (Previous, 1, 2, 3, Next) with a total count (e.g., "Showing 1 to 50 of 137 emails").

<Tip>
Monitor the "Needs Attention" tab regularly to ensure no urgent customer queries are left unaddressed. The "Waiting for" timer helps prioritize responses by age.
