## Connected Calendar

The primary integration shown in Settings is **Google Calendar**. This connection enables:

- **Two-way sync** — Appointments created in the ERP appear on your Google Calendar and vice versa
- **Availability management** — Your Google Calendar availability is reflected when booking appointments in the ERP
- **Team scheduling** — All team members can connect their Google Calendar accounts

### Connection Status

The connected calendar card shows:
- **Google Calendar** label with calendar icon
- **Connected email** (e.g., rhutik@nxtjob.ai)
- **Green checkmark** — Indicates the connection is active and healthy
- **Reconnect button** — Click to re-authenticate if the connection expires or needs refreshing

### Reconnecting

If your Google Calendar connection becomes stale or you change your Google account, click the **Reconnect** button to re-authenticate through Google OAuth. This will prompt you to sign in and grant calendar permissions again.

<Tip>
Ensure your Google Calendar is connected before using the Calendar module or booking appointments from the Pipeline. A disconnected calendar will prevent appointment sync.
