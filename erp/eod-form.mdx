## Overview

The End of Day (EOD) Form is a **stage-triggered data collection modal** in the Sales pipeline. When an opportunity moves to certain stages — either by drag-and-drop on the Kanban board or during the daily pending EOD review — the system prompts the sales rep to fill in stage-specific information.

The EOD form ensures critical data (call recordings, objections, payment details, reasons) is captured at every significant stage transition.

## How It Works

### Real-Time Trigger (Stage Progression Modal)

When a sales rep drags an opportunity to a trigger stage on the Kanban board, the **Stage Progression Modal** opens immediately. The rep must complete the form before the stage change is saved.

### Pending EOD Modal

At the end of each day, the system checks for opportunities that moved to trigger stages but may have incomplete data. The **Pending Sales EOD Modal** presents these one by one:

1. Left sidebar shows the opportunity name, current stage, and appointment date
2. Right panel displays a stage selector dropdown and the corresponding form
3. After completing one opportunity, the system advances to the next
4. Counter shows progress (e.g., "Opportunity 1 of 5")

## Trigger Stages

The EOD form is triggered for these **9 Sales pipeline stages**:

| Stage | Form Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Offer Not Made (Non-Ideal Prospect)** | No Offer | Why the prospect was non-ideal |
| **Sale - Full Pay** | Sales Pay | Full payment captured — triggers JFO/Ops lead creation |
| **Sale - Part Pay** | Sales Pay | Partial payment captured — triggers JFO/Ops lead creation |
| **Dead Follow Up Loss** | Dead Follow Up | Why the deal was lost |
| **2nd Call Booked** | Second Call Booked | Follow-up call scheduling details |
| **Uncertain Needs Time** | Uncertain | Prospect needs more time — objections and confidence tracked |
| **Received Deposit** | Received Deposit | Deposit amount and payment schedule |
| **No Show** | No Show | Prospect didn't attend the call |
| **Rescheduled** | Rescheduled | Reason for rescheduling the call |

## Fields by Stage

## Auto JFO/Operations Lead Creation

When an opportunity moves to **Sale - Full Pay** or **Sale - Part Pay** and the EOD form is submitted:

1. The backend checks the **Program Type** field
2. If **Job Force One** → A new opportunity is created in the JFO Pipeline at the **Active** stage
3. If any other program → A new opportunity is created in the Operations Pipeline at the **Active** stage
4. A Facebook conversion event is submitted for tracking
5. A "Payment Approved" note is auto-generated on the opportunity

This automation ensures seamless handoff from Sales to Operations/JFO without manual opportunity creation.

## Follow-Up Scheduling

For the **2nd Call Booked** stage, the system automatically creates a follow-up appointment in the calendar based on the **Date of Next Call** field. This ensures the next call is scheduled and visible to the sales rep.

<Tip>
Always fill in the Call Recording URL — this is critical for sales managers to review call quality and provide coaching feedback. The transcript field, while optional, helps with searchability and AI-powered analysis.
