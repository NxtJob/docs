## Data Flow

Client Persona data is stored on the **contact record**, not the opportunity. This means:

- Persona data persists across all opportunities linked to the same contact
- Updating the persona in one opportunity updates it for all associated opportunities
- The data is accessible via the contact's profile throughout the system

<Tip>
Fill in the Client Persona during the setter consultation call. The "Biggest Career Concern" and "Employment Status" fields are especially useful for the sales rep to reference when crafting their pitch.
