## The Problem for Senior Professionals

If you are a senior professional with 5, 10, or 20+ years of experience, the job market feels fundamentally different from when you last searched. Applicant Tracking Systems now reject up to 75% of resumes before a human ever reads them. The resume that landed you your current role five years ago is almost certainly not optimized for today's hiring landscape.

You need a tool that understands your seniority level, respects the depth of your career, and guides you through modern resume optimization without requiring you to start from scratch.

## The NxtJob Ecosystem

NxtJob.ai is an end-to-end job change platform built specifically for senior professionals who want to accelerate career transitions and negotiate better compensation. The platform's promise is direct: **get a salary hike in just 90 days.**

The ecosystem includes six integrated tools:

| Tool | URL | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Resume Builder** | resume.nxtjob.ai | AI-powered resume creation and optimization |
| **Job Board & Tracking** | jobs.nxtjob.ai | Kanban-style job pipeline management |
| **[Interview Prep](/interview-prep/introduction)** | interview.nxtjob.ai | Mock interviews with AI-driven feedback |
| **[Cover Letter Builder](/cover-letter/introduction)** | cover.nxtjob.ai | AI-powered cover letters tailored to job descriptions |
| **[Chrome Extension](/chrome-extension/introduction)** | Chrome Web Store | LinkedIn optimization and multi-board job scraping |
| **Community** | Accessible from sidebar | Peer networking and career guidance |

Every tool feeds into the next. Your Resume Builder output connects to the Job Board. Your Job Board applications link to Interview Prep. The [Chrome Extension](/chrome-extension/introduction) scrapes job postings directly into your pipeline.

## Why the Resume Builder Is the Starting Point

Your resume is the foundation of every job application. It determines whether you pass ATS filters, whether a recruiter spends more than six seconds on your profile, and whether you get invited to interview. The NxtJob Resume Builder is where your 90-day journey begins.

This guide covers every feature of the Resume Builder in detail, with particular depth on the scoring and optimization systems that will transform your resume from a generic career summary into a targeted, ATS-optimized, recruiter-ready document.

As a senior professional, your time is valuable. Bookmark this guide and use the sidebar to jump directly to the section you need. The [Resume Score Playbook](/resume-builder/resume-score) is the section you will return to most often.

<Tip>
Enable dark mode from the top-right toggle if you work late hours. Reducing eye strain during extended resume editing sessions makes a real difference.
