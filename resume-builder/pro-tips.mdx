This section consolidates strategic advice for professionals with 5-20+ years of experience who are optimizing their resumes for the current job market.

## Tip 1: Lead with Impact, Not Responsibilities

At the senior level, recruiters already know what a VP of Engineering or a Director of Product does day to day. They need to see what changed because you were in the role.

**Bad:** "Managed the engineering team and oversaw software development projects."

**Good:** "**Scaled engineering team from 12 to 45** across 3 offices, delivering **4 major platform releases** that drove **$8.2M ARR growth**."

## Tip 2: Calibrate Detail to Recency

Your resume is not an autobiography. Apply the recency rule aggressively:

| Career Period | Detail Level |
|---|---|
| Current/most recent role | Deep detail (4-9 bullets with full context) |
| 5-10 years ago | Moderate detail (3-6 bullets, highlights only) |
| 10+ years ago | Minimal detail (0-3 bullets, or summarize as a single line) |

A hiring manager cares about what you did in the last 5 years. Your role from 15 years ago establishes career trajectory but does not need 8 bullet points.

## Tip 3: One Resume per Application

The highest-performing job seekers maintain multiple resume variants:

1. **Primary resume** — Your strongest general-purpose version. Always updated.
2. **Role-specific variants** — Duplicated from primary, then customized for specific role types (e.g., "Engineering Manager" vs. "Director of Engineering").
3. **Company-specific variants** — Created for high-priority applications. Optimized against the specific job description using ATS Score.

Use the Duplicate feature to create variants efficiently. Rename each clearly.

## Tip 4: The 6-Second Test

Recruiters spend an average of 6 seconds on the initial resume scan. In those 6 seconds, they read:

1. Your name and headline
2. Your current company and title
3. Your previous company and title
4. Your education

Everything else gets read only if those 6 seconds pass the threshold. Structure your resume so that the top third contains your strongest positioning.

## Tip 5: Bold Strategically

Bold formatting is your tool for controlling what gets read in that 6-second scan. Bold the information you most want a recruiter to notice:

- Company names and job titles
- Quantified metrics (dollar amounts, percentages, headcounts)
- Key technologies and skills that match the job description
- Outcome statements ("reducing costs by 34%," "growing revenue by $4.2M")

Do not bold everything. Do not bold nothing. The 70% rule in the scoring system exists for a reason.

## Tip 6: Skills Section as a Keyword Bank

For ATS optimization, your Skills section serves double duty: it informs human readers of your competencies and feeds ATS keyword scanners. Treat it strategically:

- Include the exact terms from job descriptions (not synonyms or abbreviations)
- Organize into 2-4 clear categories
- Put the most relevant category first
- Include both the acronym and the spelled-out version when space permits (e.g., "Machine Learning (ML)")

## Tip 7: Avoid Common Senior-Level Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Hurts | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Including every role from a 20-year career | Dilutes focus, inflates page count | Keep to 3-4 most relevant roles in detail |
| Using the same resume for every application | Low ATS scores, generic positioning | Maintain role-specific variants |
| Listing responsibilities instead of achievements | Tells recruiters nothing new | Replace duties with quantified outcomes |
| Ignoring the Summary section | Missed opportunity to frame your narrative | Write a 60-100 word quantified summary |
| Over-designing with graphics and columns | Confuses ATS parsers | Use clean, single-column templates |
| Not updating in 6+ months | Stale keywords, missing recent wins | Schedule quarterly resume reviews |
| Buzz word overload | Signals inexperience despite seniority | Replace every buzz word with evidence |

## Tip 8: Use NxtJob as an Integrated System

The Resume Builder is most powerful when used alongside the other NxtJob tools:

1. **Build and optimize your resume** in the Resume Builder (aim for 75%+ Resume Score).
2. **Generate a cover letter** using the Cover Letter Generator, which pulls context from your resume.
3. **Find and track jobs** on the Job Board, applying with your primary resume.
4. **Prepare for interviews** using Interview Prep, which can reference your resume content to generate relevant questions.
5. **Install the Chrome Extension** to scrape job listings from LinkedIn and other boards directly into your NxtJob pipeline.

The 90-day timeline becomes achievable when all the tools work together.

## Tip 9: Test Your Resume Score Before Every Application

Before you submit any application:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Resume Score">
    Open the resume in the builder and check your Resume Score. If it is below 75%, fix the flagged items.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run ATS analysis">
    Run an ATS Score analysis against the specific job description.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Incorporate missing keywords">
    Add missing keywords to appropriate sections of your resume.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Re-check scores">
    Re-check both scores to verify improvement.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download and submit">
    Download the final PDF and submit your application.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This 5-minute pre-submission routine can be the difference between passing the ATS filter and being silently rejected.

## Tip 10: The Resume Is Step One

A great resume gets you through the door. What happens next — the interviews, the negotiations, the offer — requires additional preparation. NxtJob's 90-day system is designed to support the complete journey. Use the Resume Builder as your foundation, then leverage Interview Prep and the Job Board to maintain momentum.

<Tip>
Set a calendar reminder to review and update your primary resume on the first of every quarter, even if you are not actively searching. Career opportunities appear without warning, and a current, optimized resume means you can respond in hours instead of days.
