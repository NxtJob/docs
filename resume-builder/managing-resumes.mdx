### What Happens Behind the Scenes

When you click **+ Create New**, NxtJob creates a new resume document linked to your account. You may be offered several starting paths:

- **Choose a Template** — Select from professionally designed layouts optimized for ATS compatibility.
- **Import** — Upload an existing resume (PDF or DOCX) and NxtJob will parse it into editable sections.
- **Blank Canvas** — Start with an empty structure and build from scratch.

### Multiple Resumes for Different Roles

NxtJob places no practical limit on the number of resumes you can create. Senior professionals commonly maintain separate resumes tailored to different target roles, industries, or seniority levels.

| Variant | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Primary / General** | Your strongest all-purpose resume, always ready for quick applications |
| **Role-Specific** | Tailored for a specific job title (e.g., "VP Engineering" vs. "CTO") |
| **Industry-Specific** | Adjusted for different industries (e.g., FinTech vs. HealthTech) |
| **Company-Specific** | Customized for a particular company's job description |

<Tip>
Maintain at least three resume variants: one for your primary target role, one for an adjacent role, and one as a general-purpose document. Tailoring increases both Resume Score and ATS Score because each variant can be optimized for a different keyword set.

## Resume Actions

Every resume card provides a set of quick actions at the bottom of the card, plus an expanded menu behind the **three-dot (...)** icon.

### Mark Primary

Sets the selected resume as your default. This is the resume attached automatically when you apply to jobs through NxtJob.ai. Only one resume can be primary at a time. Access via the three-dot menu.

### Preview

Opens a read-only rendering of the resume, showing exactly how it looks when downloaded or shared. Use this to perform a final visual check before submitting. Access via the three-dot menu.

### Edit

Opens the full Resume Builder at a URL like `resume.nxtjob.ai/{resume-id}?tab=score`. You have full control over every section, template, and styling option. Access via the pencil icon or the three-dot menu.

### Download

Exports the resume as a PDF file to your local device. The PDF preserves all formatting, fonts, and layout exactly as displayed in the builder. Access via the download arrow icon or the three-dot menu.

### Rename

Opens a dialog where you can change the resume's title. Useful when repurposing a resume for a different role. Access via the three-dot menu.

### Duplicate

Creates an exact copy of the resume with the same content, formatting, and template. The duplicate appears in your library with a modified name (typically appended with "Copy"). Access via the copy icon or the three-dot menu.

<Tip>
Duplicating is the fastest way to create a role-specific variant. Duplicate your strongest resume, rename it for the target role, and adjust the summary, skills, and keywords. This preserves your proven formatting while allowing targeted optimization.
</Tip>

### Delete

Permanently removes the resume from your library. **Deleted resumes cannot be recovered.** Access via the three-dot menu.

<Tip>
Before deleting any resume, download a PDF copy as a backup. If there is any chance you will need the content again, duplicate and archive rather than delete.
</Tip>

### Share

Generates a shareable link for the resume. You can send this link directly to recruiters, hiring managers, or include it on portfolio pages. The shared view is a clean, read-only rendering. Access via the share icon on the card.

## Primary Resume

### What It Is

Your **Primary Resume** is the default document associated with your NxtJob.ai profile. It serves three critical functions:

1. **Auto-attachment** — When you apply to jobs through NxtJob.ai's Jobs feature, your primary resume is attached by default.
2. **Profile representation** — Your primary resume may be surfaced in the NxtJob Community or shown to recruiters who view your profile.
3. **Quick access** — The blue "Primary Resume" badge makes it instantly identifiable in a large library.

### Why It Matters for Senior Professionals

When you are actively job hunting and applying to multiple positions per week, having a polished primary resume saves significant time. You can apply with one click, knowing your strongest document is being sent.

### How to Set It

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the menu">
    Click the **three-dot (...)** icon on the resume card you want to designate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Mark Primary">
    Select **Mark Primary** from the menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm the badge">
    The blue "Primary Resume" badge transfers to the selected card.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You can change your primary resume at any time by repeating the steps above on a different resume. The badge automatically transfers.

<Tip>
Keep your primary resume as your most polished, general-purpose document. Update it every time you gain a new achievement, certification, or role change. A stale primary resume is a missed opportunity.
