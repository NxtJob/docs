## Overview of the Builder Interface

The Resume Builder is the core editing environment where you craft, refine, and optimize your resume. When you open a resume for editing, you arrive at a URL like `resume.nxtjob.ai/{resume-id}?tab=score`.

The interface is divided into three main areas:

1. **Top Toolbar** — Controls for Templates, Sections, Style, and Download.
2. **Left Panel (Editor)** — The full resume document with editable sections, inline formatting, and page break indicators.
3. **Right Panel (Score & Optimization)** — The scoring panel with Resume Score and ATS Score tabs, plus the full optimization breakdown.

## Top Toolbar

### Templates

Browse and apply pre-designed resume layouts. Changing templates reformats your content without losing any data. NxtJob offers templates optimized for different industries, seniority levels, and ATS compatibility levels.

### Sections

Add, remove, or reorder resume sections. Available sections include:

- Personal Details
- Summary
- Skills
- Work Experience
- Projects
- Education
- Certifications
- Achievements
- Languages
- Custom Sections (any title and content structure you define)

### Style

Adjust visual properties to match your personal brand:

- **Fonts** — Select from professional typefaces
- **Colors** — Choose accent colors for headings and highlights
- **Spacing** — Control line spacing and section gaps
- **Margins** — Adjust page margins

### Download

Export the current resume as a PDF directly from the builder. The PDF preserves all formatting exactly as displayed.

<Tip>
Choose a clean, single-column template for maximum ATS compatibility. Multi-column layouts can confuse some tracking systems, and text embedded in tables or graphics may be silently dropped during parsing.
</Tip>

## Editable Resume Sections

### Personal Details

Your name, professional title/headline, phone number, email address, location, and links (LinkedIn, portfolio, GitHub, etc.). This section appears at the top of your resume and is critical for recruiter contact.

### Summary

A rich-text paragraph summarizing your professional identity, core competencies, and career value proposition. The editor supports **bold** formatting for emphasis on key terms. Write a summary that leads with your years of experience and domain expertise.

### Skills

Skills are organized into **buckets** (groupings by category) with individual skills displayed as tags. For example, a bucket titled "Cloud & Infrastructure" might contain tags like AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Docker.

### Work Experience

Each entry includes job title, company name, employment dates, location, and bullet points describing accomplishments. The editor supports **bold formatting** within bullets for highlighting key metrics and technologies.

### Projects

Project entries include project name, dates, description bullets, and optional links. Structure bullets the same way as Work Experience: action verb + task + measurable result.

### Education

Each entry includes degree type, field of study, institution name, dates, location, and optional GPA.

### Certifications

Each entry includes certification name, issuing organization, date earned, and optional verification URL.

### Achievements

A bullet-point list of notable accomplishments such as awards, patents, publications, speaking engagements, or leadership milestones.

### Languages

Languages with proficiency levels (Native, Fluent, Conversational, Basic).

### Custom Sections

Create sections with any title and content structure for categories like Volunteer Work, Board Memberships, Open Source Contributions, or Publications.

## Section Action Buttons

Every section in the builder has a set of action buttons:

| Button | Function |
|---|---|
| **AI Generate** | Uses NxtJob's AI to auto-generate or enhance content for that section. |
| **Move Up / Move Down** | Reorders the section relative to others on the resume. |
| **Settings** | Opens section-specific configuration (visibility, layout options). |
| **Delete** | Removes the section from the resume entirely. |

<Tip>
Use **AI Generate** on your Summary and Work Experience sections first. The AI produces strong initial drafts using the CAR framework (Challenge, Action, Result) that you can then refine with your personal voice and specific numbers.
