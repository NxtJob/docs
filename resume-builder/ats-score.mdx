## What Is ATS Score?

The ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Score is a separate scoring system from Resume Score. While Resume Score measures overall quality and professional standards, ATS Score measures how well your resume matches a **specific job description**.

Most mid-to-large companies use ATS software (Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, iCIMS, etc.) to filter candidates before a human reviews the application. These systems scan resumes for keywords, phrases, and qualifications that match the job posting. If your resume does not contain the right keywords, it may be automatically rejected regardless of how qualified you are.

## How It Works

The ATS scoring engine performs keyword matching between your resume and the target job description:

1. You provide (or paste) a specific job description.
2. The engine extracts key terms and phrases from the job description.
3. It counts how frequently each keyword appears in both the job description and your resume.
4. It calculates a **match score** based on keyword overlap and frequency alignment.
5. It returns detailed data: for each keyword, it shows `countInResume` and `countInJobDescription`.

## How to Generate an ATS Score

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the builder">
    Open your resume in the Resume Builder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to the ATS tab">
    Navigate to the **ATS Score** tab on the right-side score panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste the job description">
    Paste the target job description into the provided field.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze">
    Click to analyze and review your match score and the keyword-by-keyword breakdown.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Reading the Results

The ATS analysis returns:

| Data Point | What It Tells You |
|---|---|
| **Match Score** | Overall percentage of keyword alignment between your resume and the job description. |
| **Keywords Data** | A table showing each extracted keyword, how many times it appears in the job description, and how many times it appears in your resume. |
| **Missing Keywords** | Keywords that appear in the job description but are absent from your resume. These are your highest-priority additions. |

## Why ATS Score and Resume Score Can Diverge

A resume can be beautifully written (high Resume Score) but use different terminology than the job posting (low ATS Score). Common causes:

- Your resume says "cloud infrastructure" but the job says "AWS and GCP."
- Your resume says "team management" but the job says "people leadership."
- Your resume uses abbreviations (ML, K8s, CI/CD) but the job uses full terms (Machine Learning, Kubernetes, Continuous Integration).
- Your resume focuses on different skills than what the job emphasizes.

## How to Optimize ATS Score

The AI-powered ATS optimization feature incorporates missing keywords into your resume using the following priority order:

1. **Work Experience bullet points** — Most natural and impactful placement
2. **Summary** — Good for high-level keyword inclusion
3. **Headline** — Brief but visible to ATS parsers
4. **Skills section** — Direct keyword matching

### Step-by-Step Optimization Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the ATS analysis">
    Run the ATS analysis against your target job description.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review missing keywords">
    Review the missing keywords list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Incorporate keywords naturally">
    For each missing keyword, find the most natural place to incorporate it: technical skills go in the Skills section, actions and responsibilities go in Work Experience bullets, leadership and strategic terms go in your Summary.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Re-run the analysis">
    Re-run the analysis to check your updated score.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repeat until target is reached">
    Repeat until you reach your target score.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Run the ATS analysis for **each specific job** you apply to. A single resume rarely scores well against all job descriptions. This is why maintaining multiple resume variants matters. Duplicate your primary resume, rename it for the target company, and optimize the ATS score against that specific job posting.
