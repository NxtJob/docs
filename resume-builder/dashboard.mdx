## The Command Center for Your Career Documents

## Resume Cards

Every resume in your library is represented as a card. Each card is a compact, information-dense summary of that document.

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| **Thumbnail Preview** | A miniature rendering of the full first page of your resume, showing the actual template and formatting. |
| **Resume Name** | The title you assigned (e.g., "VP Engineering - Acme Corp - Feb 2026"). |
| **Last Updated** | A relative timestamp such as "Updated 3 days ago," reflecting the last time any change was saved. |
| **Resume Score** | A percentage (e.g., 63%) in color-coded text: green (75%+), yellow (50-74%), or red (below 50%). |
| **ATS Score** | A percentage (e.g., 71%) shown only on resumes that have been evaluated against a job description. |
| **Primary Badge** | A blue "Primary Resume" label on the resume designated as your default for applications. |
| **Quick Action Icons** | A row of icons at the bottom: Share/Open, Edit (pencil), Duplicate (copy), Download (arrow), and a three-dot menu for additional options. |

### Score Display on Cards

The Resume Score and ATS Score are displayed directly on each card so you can assess quality without opening the builder. The color coding provides instant triage:

- **Green text** — This resume is strong. Ready for applications.
- **Yellow text** — This resume has a solid foundation but needs optimization.
- **Red text** — This resume needs significant work before submission.

### The "Updated X Days Ago" Timestamp

This timestamp reflects the last time any change was saved to that resume, including text edits, formatting changes, section reordering, or template switches. Use it to identify which version is most current, especially when maintaining multiple variants for different roles.

<Tip>
If a card shows "Updated 6+ months ago," the optimization engine will flag this in your Resume Score. Resumes go stale. Make it a habit to review and update every resume at least every six months.
</Tip>

## Searching & Browsing

### Search by Name

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate the search bar">
    Find the **"Search resume name"** input field at the top of the dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Type your query">
    Type any part of the resume name (e.g., "Backend" or "VP Engineering"). The grid updates in real time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clear to reset">
    Clear the search field to return to the full list.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Grid View vs. List View

Two toggle buttons sit next to the search bar:

- **Grid View** — Visual card layout with thumbnail previews. Best for scanning designs and comparing templates across resumes.
- **List View** — Compact text-based table. Best for managing a large library where you need to see names, scores, and dates at a glance.

### Strategies for Large Libraries

If you maintain dozens or hundreds of resumes (common for senior professionals who tailor documents per application), combine these strategies:

1. **Search by name** to narrow results immediately.
2. **Scan the Primary badge** to spot your default resume.
3. **Use pagination** (bottom of page) to jump to a specific page.
4. **Use List View** for faster scanning of large collections.

<Tip>
Adopt a consistent naming convention such as `[Role] - [Company] - [Month Year]` (e.g., "VP Engineering - Acme Corp - Feb 2026"). This makes search highly effective and keeps your library organized even at scale.
</Tip>

## Pagination & Navigation

### Page Controls

At the bottom of the dashboard, pagination controls display numbered page buttons (e.g., **Previous, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Next**). Click any page number to jump directly, or use **Previous** and **Next** to step through sequentially.

### Resumes Per Page

The dashboard displays a fixed number of resume cards per page. The exact count depends on your view mode (Grid vs. List) and screen resolution. With large libraries (e.g., 614 resumes), multiple pages are generated automatically.

### Navigating Efficiently

For large libraries, pagination combined with search is the most efficient approach:

1. If you know the name, use search.
2. If you are browsing recent work, check the first page (typically sorted by last updated).
3. If you need to find your primary resume, scan for the blue badge.

<Tip>
If pagination becomes unwieldy, it may be time to clean house. Delete or archive outdated resumes. A focused library with 10-20 well-maintained resumes is more effective than hundreds of abandoned drafts.
