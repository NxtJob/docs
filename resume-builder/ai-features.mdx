## AI Grammar & Spelling Correction

**What it does:** Scans your entire resume for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, and inconsistencies. Provides suggested corrections inline.

## AI Resume Review

**What it does:** Provides a holistic assessment of your resume organized into three sections:

1. **Strengths** — What your resume does well. Specific sections and elements that are effective.
2. **Improvements** — Targeted suggestions for enhancing existing content. Actionable recommendations.
3. **Weaknesses** — Areas that need significant attention. Critical gaps that may hurt your candidacy.

Look for the AI Review option in the score panel. The review considers your entire resume in context, not just individual rules.

<Tip>
Use AI features as a starting point, not a final product. AI-generated content is most effective when you layer in your specific achievements, your actual numbers, and your authentic professional voice. The AI gives you structure and language; you provide the substance.
