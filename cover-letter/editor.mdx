## Editor Layout

<Frame>

</Frame>

The editor has two main areas:

- **Center** — your cover letter, rendered in real time as you edit
- **Right sidebar** — styling controls for templates, colors, and fonts (collapsible)

Click any section of the cover letter to select it for editing. Click outside the cover letter to deselect.

## Header Section

<Frame>

</Frame>

Click the header area to edit your contact information. The following fields are available:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Your full name |
| **Title / Job Role** | Your professional title or target role |
| **Phone** | Phone number |
| **Email** | Email address |
| **LinkedIn / Portfolio URL** | Your LinkedIn profile or portfolio link |
| **Location** | City, state, or country |
| **Extra URL** | An additional link (personal website, GitHub, etc.) |
| **Extra Field** | A custom field for any additional information |
| **Photo** | Upload a profile photo (with round style option) |

Each field has a **display toggle** — click the visibility icon next to any field to show or hide it on the cover letter. This lets you include only the contact details relevant to each application.

## Body Section

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/cover-letter/editor-body.png" alt="Cover letter body section with rich text editor toolbar showing formatting options" />
</Frame>

The body section is where your cover letter content lives. It uses a rich text editor with a formatting toolbar that appears when you click into the body area.

**Available formatting options:**

| Format | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Bold** | Emphasize key phrases |
| **Italic** | Stylistic emphasis |
| **Underline** | Underline text |
| **Alignment** | Left, center, or right alignment |
| **Links** | Insert clickable hyperlinks |
| **Ordered List** | Numbered list |
| **Unordered List** | Bullet point list |

This is where the AI-generated content appears after the [creation flow](/cover-letter/creating-cover-letters). You can freely edit, add, or remove any content.

## Auto-Save

Every change you make is saved automatically with a 500ms debounce. There is no manual save button — just edit and your work persists. You can close the browser and return later to find everything exactly as you left it.

## Job Attachment Banner

If the cover letter was generated from a specific job, a dismissible notification banner appears at the top of the editor showing which job the cover letter is linked to. This is informational — it reminds you which job description was used during generation.

<Tip>After the AI generates your cover letter, always review and personalize the content. Add specific details about why you are interested in this particular company, reference a recent achievement that directly addresses a key requirement, or mention a mutual connection. AI-generated content is a strong starting point — your personal touches make it exceptional.</Tip>
