## Styling Sidebar

The right sidebar in the [editor](/cover-letter/editor) has two tabs: **Templates** and **Color & Fonts**. All changes apply instantly and auto-save.

## Templates

Four templates are available, each with a distinct visual style:

| Template | Style | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **Minimalist** | Clean layout with subtle color accents | Conservative industries — finance, consulting, legal |
| **Bold** | Strong header with prominent styling | Creative or leadership roles where presence matters |
| **Modern** | Contemporary design with balanced spacing | Technology, product, and startup roles |
| **Classic** | Traditional format with formal structure | Executive positions and established companies |

Click any template thumbnail to switch. A **"Selected"** badge appears on the active template. All templates support the same header fields and body content — switching templates changes only the visual layout, not your content.

## Color & Fonts

#### Colors

14 color swatches are available. Click any swatch to apply it — a checkmark indicates the active color. The color affects headings, accents, and structural elements depending on the template.

#### Font Family

Eight font options:

| Font | Character |
|---|---|
| **Inter** | Clean and neutral — the default |
| **Raleway** | Elegant with distinctive weight variations |
| **Poppins** | Geometric and modern |
| **Roboto** | Versatile and widely used |
| **Open Sans** | Friendly and highly readable |
| **Lato** | Professional with subtle warmth |
| **Montserrat** | Bold and contemporary |
| **Rubik** | Rounded and approachable |

#### Font Size

A three-level slider that adjusts the base font size across the entire cover letter. Move it left for smaller text (fits more content) or right for larger text (more emphasis).

#### Line Height

Three levels: **120%**, **135%**, and **150%**. Higher values add more vertical space between lines, improving readability at the cost of page length.

#### Word Spacing

A three-level slider that adjusts the space between words. Wider spacing improves readability; tighter spacing fits more content.

<Tip>Start with the Minimalist template and the default color for most applications. If you are targeting a creative or design-focused role, experiment with Bold or Modern. The Classic template works well when applying to traditional organizations that value formal presentation.</Tip>
