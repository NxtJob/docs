## What Is the Cover Letter Builder?

The NxtJob Cover Letter Builder at [cover.nxtjob.ai](https://cover.nxtjob.ai) is an AI-powered cover letter generator built for senior professionals who need polished, targeted cover letters without spending hours writing from scratch.

The builder supports two generation modes:

- **Job-based generation** — Provide a specific job description along with your resume, and the AI creates a cover letter tailored to that role, company, and set of requirements.
- **General generation** — Generate a cover letter without a job description when you need a versatile letter for networking, speculative applications, or recruiters.

Whether you are applying to a VP role at a Fortune 500 company or reaching out to a startup CTO, the Cover Letter Builder produces professional, role-specific letters that complement your resume and speak directly to the hiring manager.

## Entry Points

You can access the Cover Letter Builder from multiple places across the NxtJob platform:

## The NxtJob Ecosystem

The Cover Letter Builder sits between the Resume Builder and the Job Board in the NxtJob workflow. Your resume provides the career data that powers AI generation. The Job Board supplies the job descriptions that make each cover letter targeted. Together, these tools ensure that every application you submit is cohesive — your resume, cover letter, and job tracking all connected in a single platform.

</Steps>

<Tip>
Use the [Chrome Extension](/chrome-extension/introduction) to save jobs from LinkedIn, Naukri, Indeed, and other portals before you start writing cover letters. When you save a job, the extension captures the full job description, which you can then feed directly into the Cover Letter Builder for a targeted, AI-generated letter. Having job descriptions ready before you open the builder saves time and produces better results.
