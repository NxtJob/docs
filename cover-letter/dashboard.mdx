## Dashboard Overview

The cover letter dashboard at `cover.nxtjob.ai/all` is your home base for managing every cover letter you have created. It displays all your cover letters as cards, organized by date, with tools to search, sort, and take quick actions without opening the editor.

## Cover Letter Cards

Each cover letter in your library is represented as a card. The card provides a compact summary so you can identify the right letter at a glance.

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| **Title** | The cover letter name. New cover letters default to "New Cover" until you rename them. |
| **Attached job** | If the cover letter was generated from a job, the card displays the company logo, job title, and company name. |
| **Last edited time** | When you last modified this cover letter, shown as a relative timestamp. |
| **Date created** | When the cover letter was first created. |
| **Actions menu** | A three-dot menu in the corner of the card for quick actions like preview, download, rename, duplicate, and delete. |

## Search and Sort

Two controls at the top of the dashboard help you find the right cover letter quickly:

- **Search** — Filter cover letters by name in real time using the search bar. Type any part of the cover letter title and the dashboard updates instantly to show matching results.
- **Sort** — Choose between "Date Modified" (most recently edited first) or "Date Added" (newest first) to control the display order.

## Date Grouping

Cover letters are automatically grouped into time-based sections so you can quickly locate recent work:

- **Today**
- **Previous 3 Days**
- **Previous 7 Days**
- **Previous 30 Days**

This grouping makes it easy to find the cover letter you were working on yesterday without scanning through your entire library.

## Creating a New Cover Letter

Click the **"New Cover Letter"** button at the top of the dashboard. A new cover letter is created immediately and the editor opens with the generation modal, where you can choose to generate from a job description or start with a blank template. See [Creating Cover Letters](/cover-letter/creating-cover-letters) for the full workflow.

## Card Actions

Click the three-dot menu on any cover letter card to access quick actions without opening the editor.

| Action | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Preview** | Opens a full-page preview modal showing the cover letter as it will appear when printed. Use this to review formatting and layout before downloading. |
| **Download** | Opens the download modal where you can export the cover letter as a PDF. |
| **Rename** | Change the cover letter title. Use a descriptive name like "Senior PM - Acme Corp - Feb 2026" to keep your library organized. |
| **Duplicate** | Creates a copy of the cover letter with a new name. The duplicate is independent — edits to the copy do not affect the original. |
| **Delete** | Permanently removes the cover letter after a confirmation prompt. This action cannot be undone. |

<Tip>
Before customizing a cover letter for a similar role, duplicate the original first. This keeps your proven version intact while giving you a head start on the new one. Senior professionals applying to multiple roles in the same function will find this workflow significantly faster than starting from scratch each time.
