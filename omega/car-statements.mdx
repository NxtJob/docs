## Overview

The CAR page (`/car`) documents work experience using the **Challenge-Action-Result** framework. Users break down their past roles into structured statements that showcase impact, then AI converts these into polished resume bullet points.

CAR unlocks after SWOT Analysis is completed for the active niche.

## Layout

The page has two sections:

### Left Sidebar — Work Experience
Lists all companies with their roles. Each company card shows:
- **Company name**
- **Role title** (colored subtitle)
- **Date range** (e.g., "Jan 2025 - Present")
- **Statement count** badge (e.g., "7/6" = 7 statements, 6 minimum recommended)
- **Status indicator** — green dot for completed

Click a company/role to load its CAR statements in the main table.

**"+ Add Company"** at the bottom opens the Add Company modal.

### Main Area — CAR Table

A table with columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Challenge** | The problem or situation faced (editable text) |
| **Action** | What you did to address it (editable text) |
| **Result** | The measurable outcome (editable text) |
| **Skill** | Primary skill demonstrated, shown as a chip with variant selector |
| **Resume Statement** | "Generate Statement" button → AI-generated resume bullet point |

Each row represents one experience statement. Users fill in Challenge, Action, and Result, then tag the primary skill demonstrated.

## Adding Companies & Roles

### Add Company
Click **"+ Add Company"** to create a new company entry:
- **Company Name** — Organization name
- **Job Title** — Your role title
- **Start Date / End Date** — Employment period

**Frontend:** `components/Omega/car/modals/AddCompanyModal.jsx`
**API:** `POST /omega/create/company`
**DB Table:** `companyRecord` — companyId, userId, nicheId, companyName, roles (JSON array of {roleId, jobTitle, startDate, endDate}), currentRoleId

### Add Role
A company can have multiple roles (promotions/transfers). Click the three-dot menu on a company to add another role.

**Frontend:** `components/Omega/car/modals/AddRoleModal.jsx`

## AI Resume Statement Generation

Click **"Generate Statement"** on any CAR row to convert the Challenge-Action-Result into a professional resume bullet point.

### How it works:

1. Frontend sends the CAR data (challenge, action, result, skills, industry, role category) to the backend
2. `llmOmega.controller.ts:generateResumeStatementWithAI()` crafts a prompt that:
   - Takes the raw C-A-R inputs
   - Considers the tagged skill and industry context
   - Generates a concise, impactful resume bullet point
   - Validates quality (appropriate length, measurable results, action verbs)
3. The generated statement appears in the Resume Statement column

**API:** `POST /omega/generate/car`
**DB:** Stored in `carStatements.statement` (mediumtext)

## Toolbar Actions

| Button | Description |
|---|---|
| **Export Car** | Export all CAR data for the niche |
| **View All** | Toggle to see all CAR statements across all companies |
| **Generate Samples** | AI-generates example CAR statements for your skills to use as inspiration |
| **Recall Scenarios** | AI prompts to help recall work scenarios you may have forgotten |

### Generate Samples

Opens an AI-powered tool that generates example CAR statements for specific skills. The system:
1. Takes selected skills, experience level, and job title
2. Calls `llmOmega.controller.ts:generateCARSampleWithAIV2()`
3. Returns sample Challenge-Action-Result scenarios tailored to your profile

**API:** `POST /omega/generate/car/sample`

## Skill Coverage

Click **"View Skill Coverage"** at the bottom to open a modal showing how well your CAR statements cover your SWOT skills.

### Key Stats
- **Coverage percentage** (e.g., "7%") — What fraction of your skills are demonstrated in CAR statements
- **Total Skills** — From your SWOT inventory
- **Skills Used** — Skills that appear in at least one CAR statement

### Coverage Table
| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Skill** | Parent skill name with count of CAR statements using it (e.g., "Agile Methodology (4)") |
| **Variant** | All variants shown as colored chips (green = used in statements, orange = not yet used) |
| **SWOT** | SWOT category for reference |

Skills with 0 coverage are highlighted — these are gaps that need more CAR statements.

**API:** `POST /omega/skill-coverage`
**Frontend:** `components/Omega/car/SkillChart.jsx`

Click **"Generate Resume"** at the bottom-right to navigate to the resume generation page. This uses all SWOT skills and CAR statements to create a tailored resume for the active niche.
