## What is Omega?

Omega is NxtJob's **premium career intelligence system** that helps clients build a structured, data-driven job search strategy. It guides users through a progressive workflow — from defining career niches and analyzing skills to documenting work experience and generating tailored resumes.

## Core Workflow

```
Ignite (Onboarding) → Define Niches → SWOT Analysis → CAR Statements → Job Matching → Resume Generation
```

### Step-by-Step Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ignite Onboarding">
    Collect personal details, work history, salary, industries, and upload existing resume. Data is parsed and pre-populated across the system.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Career Niches">
    Create targeted career paths with specific job titles, industries, seniority levels, company types, and location preferences. Each niche becomes an independent track.
  </Step>
  <Step title="SWOT Analysis">
    Map all skills (soft, technical, tool) with proficiency ratings (Novice → Mastery), frequency scores from job market data, and SWOT categories. AI generates actionable improvement plans for each skill.
  </Step>
  <Step title="CAR Statements">
    Document work experience using the Challenge-Action-Result framework. Each statement links to specific skills and can be AI-generated into polished resume bullet points.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Job Matching">
    Add real job descriptions. The system analyzes fitment against niche parameters and extracts new skills/variants to add to the profile.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resume Generation">
    Generate ATS-optimized resumes tailored to each niche, pulling from SWOT skills and CAR statements.
  </Step>
