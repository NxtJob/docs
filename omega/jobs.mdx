- **Recommendation** — "Apply Now", "Consider Applying", or "Skip"

### Detailed Analysis

Click **"See Detailed Analysis"** to expand the breakdown:

| Dimension | Match Status | Example |

| **Job Title** | Match / Mismatch | "Cofounder / Head of Technology (CTO)" |
| **Function** | Strong Match / Mismatch | "Full-stack development, tech leadership" |
| **Seniority** | Match / Mismatch | Based on niche experience level |
| **Industry** | Match / Mismatch | Based on niche target industries |
| **Company Type** | Match / Mismatch | Based on niche company type preferences |

### Actions
- **Delete Job** — Remove if poor fit
- **Keep Job** — Save for later

**Frontend:** `components/Omega/jobs/modals/AnalyzeJDMatchScoreModal.jsx`
**API:** `POST /omega/generate/percentageMatchForJD` → `omega.controller.ts` → LLM analysis
**Backend:** The AI compares the JD requirements against niche parameters (job titles, industry, seniority, company type) and SWOT skills to calculate the match percentage.

## Skill Analysis

<Frame>

</Frame>

Click **"Skill Analysis"** (green button) to extract skills from the job description and compare them against your existing skill inventory.

### Results Panel

The modal shows four categories with counts:

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| **Existing Variants** | New names for skills you already have (e.g., "startup speed" as variant of "startup experience") |
| **New Skills** | Skills found in the JD that aren't in your inventory |
| **New Variants** | New variant names for existing skills |
| **Selected** | How many you've selected to add |

### Skill Cards

Each skill appears as a card:
- **Skill name** with `Existing Skill` badge if already in your inventory
- **Checkbox variants** to select which variants to add
- Guidance text: "You already have this skill - select variants to add to it"

### Actions
- Select skills/variants via checkboxes
- **"Review & Apply (N)"** — Adds selected skills and variants to your SWOT inventory
- **Cancel** — Close without changes

**Frontend:** `components/Omega/jobs/modals/AnalyzeJDModal.jsx`
**API:** `POST /omega/analyze/job/description` → parses the JD text, identifies skills, and matches against existing user skills
**Backend:** AI extracts skills from JD text, categorizes them as soft/technical/tool, identifies parent-variant relationships, and diffs against the user's current skill inventory.

## View Skills Panel

<Frame>
