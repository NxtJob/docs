## Overview

The Omega Dashboard (`/omega`) is the central hub. It displays the learning path, all career niches, and the SWOT/CAR progression status for the active niche.

## Learning Path

The top section shows a **carousel of tutorial videos** under "Your Learning Path Way". Videos are organized by foundation topics:

- **Setting up the Basics** — Initial platform orientation
- **Understanding your Niche and Job Title Alias** — How to define effective niches
- **Job Requirements Analysis** — How to analyze job descriptions

Each video card shows the topic name, a play button, the foundation label, and a "Watch Video" CTA. Navigate between videos using the left/right arrow buttons.

**Frontend:** `components/Omega/dashboard/Dashboard.jsx` renders the video carousel using data from the learning path configuration.

## Career Niches

### Niche Tabs

Below the learning path, niche tabs display all defined career niches (e.g., "Software Developer", "Frontend Developer"). The **active niche** is highlighted in green. Click any tab to switch context — all SWOT, CAR, and Job data is scoped to the selected niche.

A **"+"** button at the end lets you create new niches.

The niche selector also appears in the top-right navbar as a dropdown on SWOT, CAR, and Jobs pages, allowing quick switching without returning to the dashboard.

### Niche Status

Each niche tracks progression through three statuses:

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| **Locked** | Initial state. SWOT must be completed first. |
| **In Progress** | Currently being worked on |
| **Completed** | All SWOT and CAR steps finished |

### Creating a Niche

**Frontend:** `components/Omega/dashboard/modals/AddNicheModal.jsx`
**API:** `POST /omega/create/niche` → `omega.controller.ts:createNiche()`
**DB Table:** `userNiche` — stores nicheId, userId, primaryJobTitle, jobTitleAlias (JSON), industry (JSON), roleCategory (JSON), companyType (JSON), experience, location, targetCompanies (JSON), inclusiveKeywords (JSON), exclusiveKeywords (JSON)

### Editing a Niche

Click the three-dot menu (⋮) on any niche tab to edit or delete it. The Update Niche panel has the same fields as creation.

**Frontend:** `components/Omega/dashboard/modals/UpdateNicheModal.jsx`
**API:** `POST /omega/update/niche`

## SWOT / CAR Progression Cards

Below the niches, two large cards show the progression for the active niche:

### SWOT Card
Displays: `Strength | Weakness | Opportunity | Threat`
- Shows status badge: **Completed** (green border), **In Progress**, or **Locked**
- Click the arrow (→) to navigate to the SWOT Analysis page

### CAR Card
Displays: `Challenge | Action | Result`
- Shows status badge: **Completed** (green border), **In Progress**, or **Locked**
- CAR unlocks after SWOT is completed
- Click the arrow (→) to navigate to the CAR page

**Frontend:** `components/Omega/dashboard/BeltContainer.jsx` renders both cards. `BeltCard.jsx` renders individual progression cards with status-based styling.

**State:** `omegaSlice.js` tracks `nicheData[]`, `activeNiche`, `isLoadingNiche`, and all modal visibility flags.
