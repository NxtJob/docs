## Overview

Skills are the foundation of Omega. Every skill is scoped to a **niche** and participates in the SWOT → CAR → Resume pipeline. Omega uses a **parent-variant hierarchy** where a parent skill (e.g., "Agile Methodology") can have multiple variants (e.g., "Agile Development", "Agile Practices", "Agile Software Development").

## Skill Structure

### Parent Skills

The primary skill record. Each parent skill has:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **skillId** | UUID | Unique identifier |
| **skill** | String | Skill name (e.g., "Java", "Communication Skills") |
| **type** | Enum | `soft`, `technical`, `tool` |
| **nicheId** | FK | Which niche this skill belongs to |
| **isVariant** | Boolean | `false` for parent skills |
| **parentId** | null | null for parent skills |

### Variants

Alternate names for the same skill. Important for ATS matching — different companies use different names for the same skill.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **isVariant** | `true` |
| **parentId** | Points to the parent skill's skillId |

**Example:** Parent "Java" might have variants "J2EE", "Java EE", "Java SE"

### Skill Types

| Type | Badge Color | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Soft** | Pink/green | Interpersonal and behavioral skills (communication, leadership, teamwork) |
| **Technical** | Teal/green | Domain-specific technical knowledge (Java, React, data analysis) |
| **Tool** | Orange | Specific tools and platforms (JIRA, Docker, CI/CD) |

A fourth type `certification/qualification` is defined in constants but less commonly used.

## How Skills Enter the System

Skills can be added through multiple paths:

### 1. Resume Parsing (Ignite Onboarding)
When a user uploads their resume during onboarding, the system extracts skills and categorizes them automatically.

### 2. Skill Analysis on Jobs
When running **Skill Analysis** on a job description, the AI extracts skills from the JD and presents them for the user to add. This is the primary ongoing source of new skills.

**API:** `POST /omega/analyze/job/description`

### 3. Manual Addition
Users can add skills manually via the "+" button in the View Skills panel.

**API:** `POST /omega/create/skill`

### 4. Bulk Creation
Multiple skills can be added at once (used internally during onboarding and skill analysis).

**API:** `POST /omega/bulk/create/skills`

### 5. Skill Research
The system can suggest relevant skills based on the niche definition.

**API:** `GET /omega/research/skills` — searches the `atsSkills` table (global skills dictionary)

## Skill Lifecycle

## Database Schema

### userSkills Table

```
skillId       VARCHAR(49)   PK
userId        VARCHAR(36)   FK → user
skill         VARCHAR(256)  Skill name
parentId      VARCHAR(49)   FK → parent skill (null for parents)
nicheId       VARCHAR(49)   FK → userNiche
isVariant     BOOLEAN       true if variant
type          VARCHAR(32)   'soft' | 'technical' | 'tool'
status        VARCHAR(10)   'ADDED' (default)
createdAt     TIMESTAMP
updatedAt     TIMESTAMP

UNIQUE INDEX: (userId, skill, nicheId)
```

### atsSkills Table (Global Dictionary)

```
skillId       VARCHAR(49)   PK
skill         VARCHAR(128)  Skill name (unique)
createdAt     TIMESTAMP
```

Used by the skill search/suggestion feature. When users search for skills, this table provides autocomplete suggestions.
