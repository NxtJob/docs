## Overview

Skills are the foundation of Omega. Every skill is scoped to a **niche** and participates in the SWOT → CAR → Resume pipeline. Omega uses a **parent-variant hierarchy** where a parent skill (e.g., "Agile Methodology") can have multiple variants (e.g., "Agile Development", "Agile Practices", "Agile Software Development").

## Skill Structure

### Parent Skills

The primary skill record. Each parent skill has a name, a type (soft, technical, or tool), and belongs to a specific niche.

### Variants

Alternate names for the same skill. Important for ATS matching — different companies use different names for the same skill. Each variant is linked to its parent skill.

**Example:** Parent "Java" might have variants "J2EE", "Java EE", "Java SE"

### Skill Types

| Type | Badge Color | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Soft** | Pink/green | Interpersonal and behavioral skills (communication, leadership, teamwork) |
| **Technical** | Teal/green | Domain-specific technical knowledge (Java, React, data analysis) |
| **Tool** | Orange | Specific tools and platforms (JIRA, Docker, CI/CD) |


## How Skills Enter the System

Skills can be added through multiple paths:

### 1. Resume Parsing (Ignite Onboarding)
When a user uploads their resume during onboarding, the system extracts skills and categorizes them automatically.

### 2. Skill Analysis on Jobs
When running **Skill Analysis** on a job description, the AI extracts skills from the JD and presents them for the user to add. This is the primary ongoing source of new skills.

### 3. Manual Addition
Users can add skills manually via the "+" button in the View Skills panel.

### 4. Bulk Creation
Multiple skills can be added at once during onboarding and skill analysis.

### 5. Skill Research
The system can suggest relevant skills based on your niche definition, drawing from a global skills dictionary.

## Important Notes

- Each skill name must be unique within a niche. If you try to add a skill that already exists, you will see a duplicate error.
- Deleting a parent skill also removes all its variants.
- Skills can be updated — you can change the name, type, or move a variant to a different parent skill.
