## Overview

The Resume Generation feature (`/generated-resume`) creates **ATS-optimized resumes** tailored to each career niche. It pulls data from SWOT skills, CAR resume statements, and niche parameters to produce a targeted resume.

## How It Works

### Input Data

The resume generator uses everything built through the Omega workflow:

| Source | Data Used |
|---|---|
| **Niche** | Primary job title, job title aliases, target industries, keywords to include/exclude |
| **SWOT Skills** | All skills with their types, ratings, and variants — prioritized by frequency and rating |
| **CAR Statements** | AI-generated resume bullet points from work experience |
| **Companies** | Company names, roles, and date ranges for the experience section |
| **Onboarding** | Personal details, education, certifications |

### Generation Process

1. User clicks **"Generate Resume"** from the CAR page
2. The system assembles all data from your SWOT skills, CAR statements, companies, and onboarding profile
3. The AI generates the resume:
   - Incorporates keywords with exact spelling matching
   - Preserves existing metrics and achievements from CAR statements
   - Distributes keywords across headline, summary, work experience, and skills sections
   - Optimizes for ATS parsing while maintaining readability
4. The generated resume is rendered on screen

### AI Optimization

The resume AI specifically:
- **Keyword incorporation** — Matches target keywords from the niche (inclusive keywords) and ensures they appear naturally
- **Skill distribution** — Spreads skills across multiple sections rather than clustering them all in one place
- **Achievement preservation** — Keeps all quantitative results from CAR statements intact
- **ATS formatting** — Uses clean formatting that ATS systems can parse reliably

## Resume Output

The generated resume can be:
- Viewed in-browser as a PDF preview
- Downloaded as a PDF file
- Further edited and customized

<Tip>
Before generating your resume, check Skill Coverage on the CAR page. Gaps in skill coverage mean the generated resume will be weaker for those areas. Fill gaps with more CAR statements first for the best results.
