## Overview

The Resume Generation feature (`/generated-resume`) creates **ATS-optimized resumes** tailored to each career niche. It pulls data from SWOT skills, CAR resume statements, and niche parameters to produce a targeted resume.

## How It Works

### Input Data

The resume generator uses everything built through the Omega workflow:

| Source | Data Used |
|---|---|
| **Niche** | Primary job title, job title aliases, target industries, keywords to include/exclude |
| **SWOT Skills** | All skills with their types, ratings, and variants — prioritized by frequency and rating |
| **CAR Statements** | AI-generated resume bullet points from work experience |
| **Companies** | Company names, roles, and date ranges for the experience section |
| **Onboarding** | Personal details, education, certifications |

### Generation Process

1. User clicks **"Generate Resume"** from the CAR page
2. Frontend calls `POST /omega/generate/resume` with the niche ID
3. Backend assembles all data from SWOT, CAR, companies, and onboarding tables
4. The LLM controller (`llmOmega.controller.ts:optimizeResumeATSWithAI`) generates the resume:
   - Incorporates keywords with exact spelling matching
   - Preserves existing metrics and achievements from CAR statements
   - Distributes keywords across headline, summary, work experience, and skills sections
   - Optimizes for ATS parsing while maintaining readability
5. The generated resume is rendered at `/generated-resume`

### AI Optimization

The resume AI specifically:
- **Keyword incorporation** — Matches target keywords from the niche (inclusive keywords) and ensures they appear naturally
- **Skill distribution** — Spreads skills across multiple sections rather than clustering them all in one place
- **Achievement preservation** — Keeps all quantitative results from CAR statements intact
- **ATS formatting** — Uses clean formatting that ATS systems can parse reliably

## Resume Output

The generated resume is rendered using React PDF Renderer (`@react-pdf/renderer`) and can be:
- Viewed in-browser as a PDF preview
- Downloaded as a PDF file
- Further edited and customized

**Frontend:** `components/Omega/GeneratedResume.jsx` → `pages/generated-resume.js`
**PDF Rendering:** Uses `@react-pdf/renderer` (v4.3.2) + `jsPDF` (v3.0.1) for generation
