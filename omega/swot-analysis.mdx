## Overview

The SWOT Analysis page (`/swot`) maps all skills in your niche to a **Strength / Weakness / Opportunity / Threat** framework. Each skill gets a proficiency rating, market frequency score, SWOT category, and an AI-generated plan of action.

This is the core of Omega's career intelligence — it identifies where you're strong, where you need to improve, what opportunities exist, and what threats you face in the job market.

## SWOT Table

The main view is a full-width table with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Skill** | Parent skill name (e.g., "Agile Methodology", "Java", "APIs") |
| **Type** | Skill classification badge — `Soft` (pink), `Technical` (green), `Tool` (orange) |
| **Variant** | Skill variants/aliases as chips (e.g., "Agile Development", "Agile Practices" for Agile Methodology) |
| **Frequency** | Numeric score indicating how often this skill appears in target job descriptions |
| **Rating** | Proficiency dropdown — Novice, Familiar, Developing, Competent, Mastery |
| **Category** | SWOT classification — Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat |
| **Plan of Action** | AI-generated improvement plan with resources and links |

### Rating Scale

| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| **Novice** | Little to no experience with this skill |
| **Familiar** | Basic awareness and limited practice |
| **Developing** | Actively learning and building competence |
| **Competent** | Solid working knowledge, used regularly |
| **Mastery** | Expert-level proficiency, can teach others |

### Frequency Score

The frequency number represents how many times this skill appears across target job descriptions in your niche. Higher frequency = more market demand. Skills are sorted by frequency by default, so the most in-demand skills appear at the top.

### SWOT Category Assignment

Categories can be:
- Manually selected by the user via dropdown
- Auto-assigned by the AI when generating a plan of action

The AI considers the skill's rating, frequency, and market context when assigning categories:
- **Strength** — High rating + high frequency skills
- **Weakness** — Low rating + high frequency skills (critical gaps)
- **Opportunity** — Skills with growing market demand
- **Threat** — Skills being replaced or declining in relevance

## AI Plan of Action

Click **"Add plan of action"** on any skill row to trigger AI generation. The system:

1. Sends the skill name, rating, job title, and related skills to the backend
2. The LLM controller (`llmOmega.controller.ts:generateSwotCategoryWithAI`) uses **GPT-4.1 Mini with web search** to:
   - Determine the appropriate SWOT category
   - Generate an actionable improvement plan with verified resource links
   - Format as clean HTML with headings, bullet points, and clickable links
3. The plan appears inline in the table row with formatted resources

**Example plan output:**
> Enhance Ethyx proficiency by completing the "Ethereum Development Tutorials" on ethereum.org. Apply learned concepts by developing a decentralized application (dApp) using Ethyx.
> **Resources:** [Ethereum Development Tutorials](https://ethereum.org/...)

**API:** `POST /omega/generate/swotPlan`
**Backend:** `llmOmega.controller.ts:generatePlanOfActionAI()` — Uses OpenAI with web search to find verified learning resources
