## Overview

Ignite (`/ignite`) is the onboarding flow that collects a new user's personal details, work history, and career goals. This data pre-populates fields across the entire Omega system — niches, skills, and CAR companies.

The onboarding is a multi-step form accessed at `/ignite?step=1`.

## Step 1 — Personal Details

The first step collects foundational information:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Full Name** | Text | User's full name |
| **Phone** | Phone input | With country code selector (defaults to India +91) |
| **LinkedIn Profile URL** | URL | LinkedIn profile link for data enrichment |
| **Industries** | Multi-select | Industries with experience (e.g., "IT Services & Consulting") |
| **Years of Experience** | Number/select | Total professional experience |
| **Current / Last Drawn Salary** | Slider | Salary range in LPA (Lakhs Per Annum) — visual slider widget |
| **Current Fundamental Function** | Multi-select | Core job function (e.g., "Front-end Operations") |

## Step 2 — Resume Upload

Users can upload an existing resume which the system parses to auto-populate:
- Work experience (companies, roles, dates)
- Skills (extracted and categorized as soft/technical/tool)
- Education and certifications

The system parses the uploaded resume and extracts structured data from PDF and Word files automatically.

## Step 3 — Career Goals

Collects forward-looking career information:
- Target role types
- Target job titles
- Primary target job title
- Desired industries and companies

## Data Storage

All onboarding data is stored in the `userOnboardings` table, which has sections for:

| Section | Fields |
|---|---|
| **Personal** | name, email, phone, linkedInProfileUrl, experience, fundamentalFunction, industry, roleCategory |
| **Career Timeline** | workExperience (JSON), careerGaps (JSON) |
| **Skills & Education** | technicalSkills, softSkills, educations, certifications |
| **Career Goals** | targetRoleTypes, jobTitles, primaryTargetJobTitle |
| **Completion Flags** | Tracks form progress per section |

## Access Activation

Before reaching Ignite, users must activate Omega access at `/access`:

1. User enters an **access code** provided by their A/C Manager or sales rep
2. The system verifies the code
3. On success, Omega features are unlocked and the user is redirected to Ignite

If the code is invalid or has already been used, an error message is displayed.

## Post-Onboarding Flow

After completing Ignite:
1. User is redirected to the Omega Dashboard (`/omega`)
2. Parsed resume data pre-populates the first niche's skill inventory
3. Work experience companies are auto-created from resume data
4. User begins the SWOT → CAR → Jobs → Resume workflow
