## Overview

Ignite (`/ignite`) is the onboarding flow that collects a new user's personal details, work history, and career goals. This data pre-populates fields across the entire Omega system — niches, skills, and CAR companies.

The onboarding is a multi-step form accessed at `/ignite?step=1`.

## Step 1 — Personal Details

The first step collects foundational information:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Full Name** | Text | User's full name |
| **Phone** | Phone input | With country code selector (defaults to India +91) |
| **LinkedIn Profile URL** | URL | LinkedIn profile link for data enrichment |
| **Industries** | Multi-select | Industries with experience (e.g., "IT Services & Consulting") |
| **Years of Experience** | Number/select | Total professional experience |
| **Current / Last Drawn Salary** | Slider | Salary range in LPA (Lakhs Per Annum) — visual slider widget |
| **Current Fundamental Function** | Multi-select | Core job function (e.g., "Front-end Operations") |

## Step 2 — Resume Upload

Users can upload an existing resume which the system parses to auto-populate:
- Work experience (companies, roles, dates)
- Skills (extracted and categorized as soft/technical/tool)
- Education and certifications

**Resume parsing:** Uses `POST /omega/parse/resume` which extracts structured data from PDF/DOCX files. The frontend uses FilePond for the upload widget and Mammoth.js for Word document parsing.

## Step 3 — Career Goals

Collects forward-looking career information:
- Target role types
- Target job titles
- Primary target job title
- Desired industries and companies

## Data Storage

All onboarding data is stored in the `userOnboardings` table, which has sections for:

| Section | Fields |
|---|---|
| **Personal** | name, email, phone, linkedInProfileUrl, experience, fundamentalFunction, industry, roleCategory |
| **Career Timeline** | workExperience (JSON), careerGaps (JSON) |
| **Skills & Education** | technicalSkills, softSkills, educations, certifications |
| **Career Goals** | targetRoleTypes, jobTitles, primaryTargetJobTitle |
| **Completion Flags** | Boolean flags per section to track form progress |

**API:** `POST /omega/upsert/onboarding` — Creates or updates the onboarding record
**Frontend:** `pages/ignite.js` → multi-step form with React Hook Form + Zod validation
**Hooks:** `useOmega.js:useFetchOnboardingDetails()` and `useUpsertOnboardingDetails()`

## Access Activation

Before reaching Ignite, users must activate Omega access at `/access`:

1. User enters an **access code** provided by their A/C Manager or sales rep
2. System verifies the code via `POST /omega/verify`
3. On success, Omega features are unlocked and user is redirected to Ignite

**Error handling:**
- `InvalidAccessCodeError` — Code doesn't exist
- `AccessCodeAlreadyUsedError` — Code was already redeemed

**Frontend:** `pages/access/index.js`

## Post-Onboarding Flow

After completing Ignite:
1. User is redirected to the Omega Dashboard (`/omega`)
2. Parsed resume data pre-populates the first niche's skill inventory
3. Work experience companies are auto-created from resume data
4. User begins the SWOT → CAR → Jobs → Resume workflow
